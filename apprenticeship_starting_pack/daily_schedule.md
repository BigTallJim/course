## What is your day like?

### Monday to Thursday

#### Weeks 1 and 2

During these two weeks we'll focus on the basic skills required of a software developer.  We'll also introduce you to the tools and practices of self directed learning.

#### Weeks 3 to 7

During these five weeks, you'll have more time and flexibility to set your own goals.

**Mornings**

* **09.30–12.30: Goal-directed project work.** You'll work independently on projects to achieve goals. You'll use self-assign projects and track your own progress. Coaches will be running workshops, mini projects, 1:1s, or generally available to chat to.

**Afternoons**

* **13.30–14.00: Meditation.** Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and helps keep your brain sharp.
* **14.00–18.00: Challenges in pairs.** You'll work on a different set of challenges every week and with a different person every day. These form the main thread of the course and ensure everyone comes out with common important skills like debugging, pair programming, and web development.

#### Weeks 8-9 and 11-12 (in teams)
During these weeks you'll pair program in your teams all day.  You should, however, discuss your individual goals with your team and find a path that allows you all to succeed.

#### Week 10
During this week there's a lot of scope to be self-directed and you may choose to work solo, in pairs or in small teams.  There'll be workshops on some mornings and a range of shorter exercises to work through outside of those.

### Fridays
On most Friday's we'll set you a programming challenge to cement the skills you learnt during that week.  As with all the programming tasks you'll undertake here, the goal is to learn, rather than complete.
