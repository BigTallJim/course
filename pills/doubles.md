Doubles (Mocks)
=======

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Doubles or Mocks are a mechanism to fake out object behaviour so that we can test other objects in isolation, or we can insulate our tests from the effects of random behaviour or 3rd party APIs.  Doubles may also be called Spies, Mocks or Stubs, and are a common pattern in many testing frameworks.  They can be extremely tricky to work with if not used carefully since they often use the process of Monkey-Patching (or Duck-Punching) to adjust the operation of an existing object.
