# Semantic HTML

HTML (or HyperText Markup Language) is one of the most underappreciated technologies we teach here at Makers, and it's easy to understand why. At first glance, it's rather simplistic, easy to learn and seemingly needs CSS and/or Javascript to do anything remotely exciting.

But in actual fact, HTML is the backbone of the web. It's the cradle that keeps your content organised and accessible - and if it weren't for those angle-brackets, the web would be a very dark place indeed.
