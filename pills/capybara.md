**What is Capybara?**

Capybara is a ruby gem that allows you to easily test the user experience of a web-based application. It provides methods that can mimic the actions a user would make in the browser, and test the outcomes of those actions in terms of what the user should be able to see. These methods can be used in conjunction with RSpec or Cucumber (or other test frameworks such as minitest, which are not covered in this course).
