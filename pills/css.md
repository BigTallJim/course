Key concepts for understanding CSS

1. Selectors

Through 'selectors', CSS provides a mechanism for specifying some subset of the HTML elements in a page.  There ar.e various types of selector, but the most common are those that specify id ('#id'), class ('.class') and tag ('tag').  These can be combined to specify more precise subsets of the tags in a page, e.g. the selector 'p.warning' would specify all the 'paragraph' tags with the class of 'warning', while 'section#example' would match all the 'section' tags with an id of 'example'

2. Box Model

CSS treats every HTML element as if it were a box with various types of spacing layered around it's internal content:
