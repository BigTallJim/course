Athletic Coding
==============

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Athletic Coding is a term coined by Professor Philip Johnson of University of Hawaii.  The idea is not unlike that of code kata, but with an explicit focus on increasing the speed with which the kata can be completed, and also a video walkthrough of the solution, so that students who are failing to complete the task within a specific time, can watch the walkthrough and then re-attempt.
