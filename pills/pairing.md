Pair Programming
================

Pair programming is the process whereby two people actively collaborate on developing code.  Used as part of a general teamwork approach it leads to improved code quality, team communication, knowledge share and huge learning gains.  [Large scale studies of computer science students](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs121/supp/williams_prpgm.pdf) have shown greatly improved outcomes when students pair program on coding problems.  In the past, pair programming has been restricted to those able to meet in the same location, however it is now possibley to remote pair program very easily using tools such as ScreenHero, Nitrous.io or simply Google Hangouts or Skype and [Github Pong](github_pong.md).

In fact [Github Pong](github_pong.md) can also be used by co-located programmers to avoid the need to share keyboards or screens.  Github Pong is recommended in that it encourages regular committing to Github and will massively boost your git skills.  However the key component of pair programming is regular driver/navigator switching&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:.  When pair programming, at any one time, one person should be the driver, i.e. the person actually typing, while the other pair should be the navigator.  The navigator's role is to try and think more broadly about where the code is going; to act as a sounding board to the driver and to offer suggestions on architectural design or to be looking up documentation related to the task at hand.  The navigator should avoid constantly mentioning spelling mistakes and other typos unless the driver is really stuck.

It's absolutely critical that you swap driver and navigator roles frequently - probably at least once every 15 minutes.  If one person carries on driving for the whole session both parties learning and code quality will be impaired.  Whether you are extrovert or introvert, driver or navigator it is the responsibility of both of you to rotate roles.  Don't be a keyboard hog!

Pair programming can be very exhausting as it will often lead to a state of very highly focused concentration.  Make sure you take occasional breaks (say every 90 minutes), and remember that learning how to effectively pair with individuals from all backgrounds and personality types is at least as important as any individual coding skills.  Employers will often care more about your ability to work with others than they do about you knowing particular technologies.

Styles
------

### Side by Side

This is not really true pairing.  It's just two people working on a related or similar problem while happening to be sitting next to each other.  It's friendly but doesn't give much benefit compared with working completely separately on a problem

### Master Slave 

Navigator tells driver exactly what to do and driver follows blindly.  In this case at least both parties are involved and the driver is building up some muscle memory from typing; however they may feel completely lost and not be gettig so much out of the experience.  It may be frustrating to the 'master navigator' to do anything other than slow down - they may want to just get in there and type themselves, but the key to both parties long term learning is to the process

### Lose the Navigator

If the driver and the navigator both go silent and the driver pushes on regardless we have a situation where we effectively "lose the navigator".   Basically the driver is now solo programming and, at best, the navigator is perhaps picking up a few things from watching.

### Driver in Narrative Mode

In this context the driver is explaining their thought process as they type, as they reflect on how to solve the problem.  The navigator can thus stay in touch with what is going on and is in a better position to ask helpful questions and make suggestions.  Working in narrative mode (i.e. explaining what you are doing as you are doing it) is tough and takes practice; but that is worthwhile since you will become a better pair partner if you develop your narrative skills.

### Regular Swapping Roles - shared head space

This is the pinnacle of effective pairing.  Both navigator and driver are in narrative mode, and are taking turns speaking, and swapping driver/navigator roles at appropriate intervals.  This is exhausting compared to working solo, but while it sometimes seems like you are going more slowly, it can help both individuals focus in a way that's not possible individually.  Furthermore the process of discussing and debating (within reason) the various aspects of what you are doing helps both parties to better remember what they are discovering through the pairing process.  Both parties need to be assertive in asking the other to speed up or slow down to find the best compromise speed for the pair, and also assertive in terms of saying things like "I'm really stuck now, can we take a 15min break?" or "shall we both go and read the documentation for 30 minutes and then come back together to discuss what we worked out".  The ultimate goal is a process of co-discovery, but you need to negotiate with your pair partner to get the best out of the process.
