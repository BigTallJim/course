# Learning at Makers

## Learning to learn

* 60% of a junior developer's time is spent learning.

* The better you are at learning, the faster you'll get better at being a developer.

* The goal of the course is to learn to learn.

* Some of these learning skills will be developer-specific: learning to read code, to read documentation, to follow a program's execution...

* Some of these learning skills will be general: learning to research, to get information into a format in which you can manipulate it, learning to teach someone else, learning to abstract...

* Ultimately, learning to to reflect on what you're doing and figure out ways to do it better next time.

* When does learning to learn stop? Never.  Even very skilled developers spend a lot of their time learning.

## Self-led learning

* Learning to learn means you are able to lead your own learning.

* This is a powerful position to be in, because you can teach yourself anything.

## Concretes, concepts, skills, behaviours

### Concretes

* E.g. what arguments does `slice` take in Ruby?
* Facts.

### Concepts

* E.g. the idea of a variable and how it works.

### Skills

* E.g. debugging.

* Skills are a focus at Makers.

### Behaviours

* E.g. [XP values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html): simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, courage.

* If you exhibit these behaviours, everything else mostly takes care of itself.

* Behaviours are a focus at Makers.

## Challenge-based learning

* You'll spend lots of the first six weeks working through challenges. These are worksheets that ask you to do things like "implement a method that does BLANK".

* The goal is not progress, but learning.  It's fine to complete 10 out of 22 challenges, as long as you played and explored.

## Escalation process

* One of the learning tools at Makers is the [escalation process](./escalation_process.md).  This is a series of things to do to try to solve a problem.  It's designed to maximise the amount you learn, rather than getting an answer right away.  It includes coming up with a clear problem explanation, talking to your pair programming partner, Googling, asking on Slack Overflow, and finally asking a coach.

## The role of the coaches

* We're here to support you learning to learn.  We might sometimes be less helpful in order to support your learning.

### Examples

* You don't have a clear problem explanation.  We might ask you questions to help you clarify your explanation.

* You ask us for a concrete piece of information. We might suggested you look it up.

* You ask us for an intro to a concept.  We might suggest a good blog post on the concept.

* You have a bug you're stuck on.  We might guide you through a methodical debugging process.
