Pair Scaffolding
================

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Pair Scaffolding is the process of a third person working with two pairing programmers to help those programmers with their pairing style and their use of the pairing protocols such as ping-pong, change-the-message, one-undermanship, github-pong and so on.

It is different from simply helping programmers with a technical issue in that pair scaffolding focuses on trying to help improve the pairing technique in order to be able to solve technical challenges themselves.  This extends to advice on how to communicate, screen set up, seating, position of keyboards and other logistics not directly related to solving a particular technical challenge.
