Retrospective and Scrum formats
===============================

Scrum
-----

One simple scrum technique is to go round each person in the group and have each person answer the following three questions.

1. What did you do?
2. Anything blocking you?
3. What are your plans?

Ideally scrums will not last longer than 15 minutes.  Each person should spend no more than a minute or so on their questions.  Any longer discussions that break out should be moved to meetings at later dates.  

Retrospective
--------

Retrospectives should be time boxed (1 or 2 hours) and used to look back at the changes that were made, how they worked out, new problems that arise; a general looking back at what worked and what didn't work.

* StartStopContinue - everyone writes down things they think should be started, stopped and continued, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* LikeLoveLoathe - everyone writes down things they like, love and loathe, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* Fishbowl - only two people (sitting on special seats) can talk at one time - people queue up to take those seats

Planning
-------

Planning meetings should focus on making plans of action for the next short time period, e.g. 1 week
