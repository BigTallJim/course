Scrum
-----

One simple scrum technique is to go round each person in the group and have each person answer the following three questions.

1. What did you do?
2. Anything blocking you?
3. What are your plans?

Ideally scrums will not last longer than 15 minutes.  Each person should spend no more than a minute or so on their questions.  Any longer discussions that break out should be moved to meetings at later dates.  

Retrospective
--------

* StartStopContinue - everyone writes down things they think should be started, stopped and continued, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* LikeLoveLoathe - everyone writes down things they like, love and loathe, and these are all written up in a shared space, for subsequent discussion
* Fishbowl - only two people (sitting on special seats) can talk at one time - people queue up to take those seats
