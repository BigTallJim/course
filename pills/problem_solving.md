Problem Solving
==============

Here's some tips on general problem solving when you have a specific question to answer:

1. Read the Question
2. Work out the INPUT and OUTPUT, trying to avoid thinking about how to solve the problem --> tests
3. Hard code a test pass that connects INPUT and OUTPUT to ensure your whole stack is working
4. Then alternate between:

  i. searching google  
  ii. trying things in irb/console (any REPL)  
  iii. re-reading the question  
  iv. discussing hypothesis and counter-hypothesis with your pair partner for max 5 mins before running experiments  
  v. keep choosing things to try randomly  
  vi. keep a journal of what you have tried  
  vii. post questions on slack, slack-overflow, and stack-overflow  
  viii. have a break and go work on a different problem or just relax, and then come back to this one
