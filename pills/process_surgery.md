# Process surgery

Work with a group to improve your developer processes.

## Required materials

* A private room.
* A whiteboard.
* 30 minutes.
* A small group (2 - 7).

## Format

* 2 - 7 students gather in a room.

* A coach can facilitate, but the session can also be student-run.

* Someone talks about a struggle they've been having e.g.
  * "I couldn't figure out a domain model for my project."
  * "My pair partner kept grabbing the keyboard from me."
  * "I'm struggling to understand RSpec."

* The person is encouraged to laser in on what the underlying problem was.

* Write a summary of the struggle in a few words on the whiteboard.

* The group discusses what developer processes could be changed to help with the struggle e.g.
  * "Try diagramming the domain model on paper."
  * "Deliver feedback to the pair partner about how it feels when they grab the keyboard."
  * "Try drawing a semantic web."

* Write the suggested developer processes on the board underneath the struggle summary.

* Repeat.

* At the end, circulate a photo of the whiteboard to the members of the group.
