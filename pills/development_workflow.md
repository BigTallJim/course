# Development workflow

1. Create a Github issue in the relevant repository relating to the user story or bug.

2. When you are ready to work on the user story, create a branch it, e.g. `dates-on-apply-page`.

3. When you are done, create a pull request from your branch to `master`.

4. Get another member of the team to review your PR.

5. When you get a :shipit: or other similarly appropriate emoji, merge your PR.

6. When you're happy, merge your changes on GitHub. You should then deploy immediately. If you have CI setup you can get it to do this for you automatically.

7. Do some QA on your live site if you have it setup.

8. Highfive someone/something.
