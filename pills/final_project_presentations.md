# Final Project Presentations

Here are some guidelines for your final project presentations:

* The time limit is 5 minutes.  Practice, practice, practice to ensure you come in under the time limit.  You'll be cut off at 5 minutes!

* To guide you on what to include, think what you found interesting about other peopleâ€™s presentations.

* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.

* Explain very briefly a scenario where someone might use your app.

* Make a video that demonstrates a user using your app.  One of your team can describe what's going on as the video plays.  No need for a live demo (every time I've done a live demo, at least one thing has gone wrong).

* Describe any interesting struggles you had with teamwork, learning or programming.  Describe how you overcame them.

* Describe the architecture of your project.  Make sure a non-technical audience will be able to understand your description.  Don't just list the technologies you used.  Instead, perhaps describe how information flows through your architecture.

* There's no need to talk about the future direction of the project.  Focus your presentation on what you've already achieved.

* Make sure your presentation is on a computer that has HDMI.
