# Apprenticeship goals vs standard points

## I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code
<details><summary>Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language</summary>
  <p>Apprentices can write code to achieve the desired functionality and which is easy to read and understand, with good naming, indentation and commenting, and applying the fundamentals of good coding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Development paradigms (where this is object oriented programming this must include inheritance, abstractions, encapsulation, polymorphism)</li>
    <li>Software programming languages</li>
    <li>Software development tools (IDEs)</li>
    <li>Writing programs and methods</li>
    <li>Language-specific idioms</li>
    <li>Logic and flow-of-control</li>
    <li>Elements of programming – variables, assignment statements, data types, conditionals, loops, arrays, and input/output.</li>
    <li>Functions - modular programming dividing a program into components that can be independently debugged, maintained, and reused writing at least two reusable functions</li>
    <li>Algorithms and data structures - classical algorithms for sorting and searching, and fundamental data structures.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details><summary>Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Can identify and follow standards and good practice that can improve programming efficiency, style and quality, including programming standards, both organisational and external generic best practices including readability, reusability, maintainability</li>
    <li>Can follow best practice approaches of different paradigms and languages</li>
  </ul>
</details>
</details>
<details><summary>Can interpret and follow company defined ‘coding standards’ or industry good practice for coding</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Can adapt to the employers domain and context for software development and interpret and follow the software development approach being implemented</li>
    <li>Can read software designs and functional/technical specifications, especially those based upon the employer domain and context</li>
    <li>Can identify, interpret and follow ‘coding standards’</li>
    <li>Can identify, interpret and follow best practice coding approaches for specific paradigms and languages</li>
    <li>Can identify, interpret and follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details><summary>Logical and creative thinking skills</summary>
  <p>a. Logical thinking:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding initial premise(s) and preconditions</li>
    <li>Analysing situations from known facts</li>
    <li>Recognising the conclusion to be reached</li>
    <li>Proceeding by rational steps</li>
    <li>Evaluating information, judging its relevance and value</li>
    <li>Supporting conclusions, using reasoned arguments and evidence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>a. Creative thinking:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Looking at situations from a fresh perspective</li>
    <li>Exploring ideas and possibilities</li>
    <li>Making connections between different aspects</li>
    <li>Questioning assumptions</li>
    <li>Generating solutions that may be imaginative or unconventional</li>
    <li>Devising new approaches</li>
    <li>Adapting ideas and approaches as conditions or circumstances change</li>
  </ul>
