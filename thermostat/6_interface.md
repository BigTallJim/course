# Thermostat: Interface

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

### Challenge setup

### Learning Objectives covered

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- [ ] Build a static HTML page as the user interface for your thermometer (hint: is there a static HTML page already in your project that you could use as a template?).
- [ ] Add JavaScript to enable your HTML page to interact with your thermostat object. Think again about separation of concerns. Where should this new JavaScript code go?
- [ ] Add a file to place your JavaScript code that manages the interface between the UI and the thermostat object.
