# JavaScript Basics

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

A new language means a new environment. So far, you've been used to using IRB or Pry to try out small code experiments and load your own files. However, this week, the focus is on browser-based (also known as client-side) JavaScript, which means that you'll need to get familiar with some new tools.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Describe JavaScript as a scripting language built for the web
- Understand JavaScript's role in the browser ecosystem
- Use the Chrome console as a REPL
- Understand JavaScript language conventions
- Analyse some differences between Ruby and JavaScript syntaxes, such as the primacy of `function()` in JavaScript vs. the primacy of `Object` in Ruby

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Find the Chrome DevTools Console
- [ ] Write your first "Hello world!" using `console.log()`
- [ ] Create a `Greeting` object with a method `hello(person)`, which will output "Hello, Maker!" when you type `greeting.hello("Maker")`
- [ ] Create a `hi` function which will output "Hi, Maker!" when you type `hi("Maker")`
- [ ] Ensure all your code follows [basic JavaScript conventions](/pills/js_conventions.md)
