# Thermostat: APIs

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Wouldn't it be good if before setting your thermometer's temperature, you knew what the weather was like outside and then you could set the thermometer's interface appropriately?

Add a feature to display the weather in a city selected by the user.

### Challenge setup
