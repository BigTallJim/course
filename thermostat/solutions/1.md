# Solution - JavaScript basics

[Back to the Challenge](../1_javascript_basics.md)

Let's write some JavaScript! 

Fire up Chrome (you can do this in Safari or Firefox, but the Chrome DevTools console is extremely well designed and user friendly). Next, find the DevTools console - the ninja way (and therefore the best way) is to use a keyboard shortcut - `Cmd`-`Opt`-`j` on a Mac, and `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`j` elsewhere. Otherwise, you can right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect element" (`Cmd`-`Opt`-`i` or `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`i` if you prefer shortcuts!) to show the DevTools, and then click on "Console".  

Hello world is relatively simple: `console.log("Hello world!")`. `console.log()` is the equivalent of `puts`, `print` or `p` in Ruby, and you will probably use it a lot to debug your code.

To create a `Greeting` object, we use the `function` keyword:

```javascript
function Greeting() {

}
```

To define a method:

```javascript
Greeting.prototype.hello(person) {
  console.log("Hello, " + person + "!");
}
```

And to use it:

```javascript
var greeting = new Greeting();
greeting.hello("Maker"); // "Hello, Maker!"

/*
Note:
- Single line comments in JavaScript use "//"
- Multiline comments use "/*" and "*/" to open and close
But, you should almost never need these as your code should explain itself! =)
*/
```

For a standalone function:

```javascript
function hi(person) {
  console.log("Hi, " + person + "!");
}
```

And to use it:

```javascript
hi("Maker"); // "Hi, Maker!"
```

While you are here, take a minute with your pair partner to take a glance at the different parts of Chrome's DevTools, especially the "Elements" tab - you will be using these a lot in the future. 

Once you feel comfortable with using the browser's JavaScript console to play with code ideas, let's start writing some TDD JavaScript.
