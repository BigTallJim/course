# Solution - Thermostat: interface

[Back to the Challenge](../6_interface.md)

Working from the code we had in the earlier solution (your code may well be different), there are a few input elements that are fairly obvious from the code, as they are the thermostat's public API used in the tests:

- `thermostat.up()`
- `thermostat.down()`
- `thermostat.reset()`
