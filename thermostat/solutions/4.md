# Solution - Airport Challenge in JavaScript

[Back to the Challenge](../4_airport_challange_js.md)

### Step 1

At this point you should be comfortable with setting up Jasmine, so we'll dive straight in to the code.

The first place I prefer to start with this kata is the plane, seeing as it's very simple in its logic and complexity.

We're going to use **strict mode**, which you can read up on here: [MDN - Strict Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode). To invoke strict mode, place this at the top of your file:

```JavaScript
"use strict";
```

First we want to give the user the ability to create a plane object by running `new Plane();`. Let's set up our test file (and jump right in to writing our first test while we're at it):

```JavaScript
describe("Plane", function() {
  var plane;

  beforeEach(function() {
    plane = new Plane();
  });

  it("is in-flight when created (for some bizarre reason)", function() {
    expect(plane.isAirborne).toEqual(true);
  });
});
```

**NOTE** there is premature optimisation in this test file to speed up the pace of the tutorial since you will have been through these set up steps previously in the week.

Now we need to declare a `function` - specifically an `Object()` *constructor function* so that we can use the `new` keyword to **construct an object.**

```JavaScript
function Plane() {}
```

Now we need our first test to pass. In an effort to be the first aircraft manufacturer to create a plane whilst it's in the air, we need to make sure that every new `plane` object has a property that reflects the `airborne` status as being `true` from the start:

```JavaScript
function Plane() {
  this.isAirborne = true;
}
```

So here we should notice two things:
1. Our `isAirborne` property is situated between the `{}` of our `Plane` object constructor function.
2. The `this` keyword is employed.

In regards to #1, it's enough right now to be aware that this is where we store the property of an object. However, #2 is going to involve a [little bit of research on your part](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/). As a quick summary though, `this` tells the JavaScript interpreter that `isAirborne` belongs to `Plane`.

Great! Now we're defying gravity, let's find a way to bring this bird to the ground. Write a test for a `land` method:

```JavaScript
it("can land", function() {
  plane.land();
  expect(plane.isAirborne).toEqual(false);
});
```

And now to create our method. As you will have noticed, we place the _properties_ of an object "inside" that object. However, when we are writing methods that relate to the same object, we use a different technique:

### The `prototype` keyword
