# The Basics

In this week we are aiming to get you ready with a lot of basic concepts and practices that will be the base for your further development as a web developer. Although they might look simple, it is really important that you grasp these concepts.

Each week we will be working on a project that will solidify your understanding of the techniques and practices you'll be learning day by day; this week we are going to build a simple terminal based student directory.
