Congratulations on reaching Week 7 and attaining senior cohort status! From this point on, you will notice that there is far less 'scaffolding' in the walkthroughs. It is assumed that on reaching this stage in the course you are more familiar with technical language, reading documentation and utilising resources such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), your byte group and your pair.

This week's project involves using JavaScript to consume data available from third parties over the network (e.g. Github API data accessed via Ajax) and using more advanced JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks such as AngularJS.

***Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials.  Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.***

*Many thanks to [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie) for the original design of the Ajax material and [Antony Denyer](https://github.com/antonydenyer) for the Angular material*

[Note also that the initial code for this walkthrough is available in https://github.com/makersacademy/angularjs-intro]
