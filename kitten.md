# First day? Let's do something just for fun!

Welcome to Makers Academy! Are you ready for the ride?

Today we are going to take things slow, we want you to have some fun before we start working through the material of this course and begin our journey; we want to give you a glimpse of what it will feel like to be a software developer!

We'll build a website that allows you to create a motivational poster using an image and text that the user inputs.

![twain](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/twain.png)

This is what the website will look like when you build it.

![motivational](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/motivational_sample.png)

You're strongly encouraged to type in all code instead of copy-pasting it. This will really help your understanding of how everything works.

We can't stress this enough. Copy and Paste is the DEVIL!! Even though at times you will be copying chunks of code, the simple process of typing it yourself will help you learn. Trust us. You can't cut corners.

## What you'll need

- [Google Chrome browser](http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/). It's very well suited to web development ( _Safari; bundled with your Mac will do fine as well though_ ).
- [SublimeText editor](http://www.sublimetext.com). This is a very convenient text editor that we'll be using.
- Make sure you know how to run Terminal (it's already installed on every Mac). Find it in your Applications (in the Utilities folder) and launch it. ![finder](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/finder.png)
- XCode command line tools. Go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/, click "View downloads" under Xcode 5 section, enter your Apple ID (you use it to get content from AppStore or iTunes), create one if you don't have it, select "Command Line tools for OS X Mountain Lion XCode5", download and follow the installation instructions.![finder](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/command_line_tools.png)
- Once you have installed XCode, install Heroku Toolbelt from https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ 
- Install RVM. 
Type this in the Terminal window.

```
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.0.0
```

## Version 0: Create a walking skeleton

Create a new directory on your desktop called "motivational-posters" (note the hyphen). Launch Sublime Text editor that you installed before and open this directory by choosing File->Open. 

You should see a window like this.

![subl](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/subl.png)

This is the directory where all our files for our web page will be stored. Let's begin by creating a file called app.rb. The .rb extension means that this is going to be a Ruby file. Ruby is a programming language that many websites are built with. Today we'll be using a tiny bit of Ruby but our website will be built using mostly Javascript â€“ another programming language.

Right click the folder name and create a new file.

![new_file](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/new_file.png)

Sublime Text will create an untitled file first. Press `Cmd-S` to save it as app.rb.

Let's create the most basic web page first. It will show the text `"Hello, world!"`. Put this into the app.rb.

```` ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
    "Hello, world"
end
````

We'll get back to what this means in a second. Let's see if it works first.

Open the Terminal. It will look like this.

![term](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/term.png)

The Terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It's also called the command line, the shell or the CLI (command-line interface). It's used by all web developers on a daily basis. It may seem strange to use a text-based interface at first (after all, we've got beautiful graphical interface on a Mac) but it's actually very convenient once you get used to it.

In the Terminal you're always in some directory, just like you're always viewing contents of some directory in Finder. Let's open the directory we need in the Terminal. Type this command:

`cd ~/Desktop/motivational-posters`

Note that there's a space after cd. The cd commands stands for "change directory". After the command is the address of the directory that we just created a few minutes ago. The "~/Desktop" is your Desktop (yes, it's just a normal directory) and "motivational-posters" is what we have created for our project.

Now that we're in the motivational-posters directory, let's install some more software that we'll need. First, type ruby -v to make sure you've got Ruby installed. The Terminal should look like this.

![term_ruby](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/term_ruby.png)

In this case, the version of Ruby is 2.0.0.p0. If yours is different, for example, 1.9.3 or 1.8.6 it isn't a problem. If you don't see the version number, it means you haven't got Ruby installed and you need to go back to the installation instructions.

Now let's install the software that we'll need. To build a website, we'll need something called a framework. This is a piece of software that acts as a bridge between your code and the browser. It will read the app.rb file and make sure it's available in the browser. Let's install it. Type this in the Terminal to install a framework called Sinatra.

`gem install sinatra`

You should see something like this (it may take a minute).

![sinatra_gem](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/sinatra_gem.png)

Now that you've got Sinatra, let's launch our "Hello, world" website. Type this in the Terminal to run the app.rb file.

`ruby app.rb`

Now you're telling your Ruby to execute the file that we've created earlier.  You should see this in the Terminal (the previous lines that we typed were cleared because they are no longer relevant).

![sinatra](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/sinatra.png)

This message means that your website is up and running at the address `localhost:4567` (note the last line). This is a special address that is used for running websites locally. (If your website starts on the address `localhost:3000`, it's ok as well, just use that address). Now open a new browser window and type this address in. You should see "Hello, world".

![localhost](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/localhost.png)

If you see this, you've just made your first step towards developing your first website! This doesn't look like a website yet but it's actually a fully functioning website that we'll be extending and improving until we are happy with the result.

Let's get back to the contents of the app.rb file. Here's what it looks like.

````ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Hello, world"
end
````

As we mentioned above, this is a Ruby file, that is, a programme written in a programming language called Ruby. It's very simple. On the first line we tell Ruby to use the Sinatra framework that we've installed previously. Then, on line 3 we're telling it that when we go to the index page of the website (the last "/" in "localhost:4567/"), it should display "Hello, world" on this page. This is exactly what we're seeing in the browser.

Let's practice changing this page. Go back to the terminal and stop your server by pressing Ctrl-C. You should see "Sinatra has ended his set" message.

![sinatra_stop](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/sinatra_stop.png)

Now go back to app.rb in Sublime Text and change the text to "Motivational Posters". Pay attention to the quotes around the text, they are important and they must be the same, that is, either single or double quotes but both of the same type.

````ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Motivational Posters"
end
````

Now go back to the terminal and start your website again.

`ruby app.rb`

Refresh the page in the browser and you should see the new text.

![motivational](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/motivational.png)

**That was all for our first version, great job!**

## Version 1: Let's build the front end

Now we have a very simple but functioning website. Let's add some HTML to it to make in more interesting.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the language that is used to create webpages. All websites you're using daily are built using HTML.

It's inconvenient to put our HTML right into app.rb. It will be easier to create a separate file. Just like you created app.rb in Sublime Text, create a folder called `views` and a file index.erb inside it. Your project now should look like this.

![index_erb](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/index_erb.png)

Why don't we move the text `"Motivational Posters"` from our app.rb into this file?

![index_erb_motivational](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/index_erb_motivational.png)

One last thing we need to do is to tell the app.rb file to actually use this file. Update your Ruby code to this.

````ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  erb :index
end
````

Line 4 here means: take the contents of index.erb and output it to the browser. What about the views folder? Sinatra looks there by default: it's where most developers using Sinatra keep HTML files, so you don't have to specify it.

Restart your website as you've done before (Ctrl-C and then ruby app.rb again) and refresh the browser. It should look exactly like before.

Now let's add some real HTML into index.erb. Every HTML file must have the following structure.

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Title of the website</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
````

Replace the contents of the index.erb with this HTML code.

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Motivational Posters</h1>
  <p>By Tonight I'll have a fully functioning website!</p>
</body>
</html>
````

Go back to the browser (no need to restart the website this time, it's only necessary if you modify app.rb). You should see this.

![localhost_motivational](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/localhost_motivational.png)

If you see this, you know you're on the right track: your website is up and running and it loads HTML code from index.erb.

## Version 2: Adding some style

CSS (stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is the technology that is used to define how your website looks. Right now it doesn't look anything special: black text on a white background but if we add a little bit of CSS, it'll be different.

Let's choose the background for our website first. Go to [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com) and choose any background that you like. It will help if your background is light, and not dark. Download the background you chose from the website and unzip it. There will be two images there and a `readme` file. For example, this is the background I chose (unzipped).

![ricepaper](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/ricepaper.png)

Take the smaller of the two images (ricepaper_v3.png) in this example and put it in the `public/images` folder in motivational-posters directory (use Finder to do it). You'll need to create the folders `public` and `images` first. After you do this, your project will look like this.

![index_erb2](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/index_erb_2.png)

Now let's set this image as the background for our website. Update line 6 in index.erb to do this.

![index_erb3](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/index_erb_3.png)

We have just added some CSS code to tell the browser that the body of our page, that is, everything that's visible on the screen, should use the file that we put into the images folder as the background image. Our page now looks like this.

![browser1](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/browser_1.png)

I bet you can see where it's going. By adding various CSS rules one after another we will make our website look good in almost no time!

Even though we can put CSS in the HTML file, it's inconvenient. We'll be writing a lot of CSS, so let's put it into a separate file. Create a folder `css` inside the `public` folder and then create a file application.css inside `public/css`. Your project structure will look like this.

![appcss](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/appcss.png)

Now let's move our CSS code from the HTML file into here. Remove the CSS from index.erb, so that the `<body>` tag has no attributes:

`<body>`

Then add this CSS into public/css/application.css:

````css
body {
  background-image: url(/images/ricepaper_v3.png)
}
````

Obviously, you'll need to replace ricepaper_v3.png with another filename if you have chosen a different background.

This CSS code tells the browser that this background image should be used for the `body` element in HTML. However, if you refresh your browser right now, there will be no background at all. This is because we haven't told the browser to use this CSS file.

In order to tell the browser to load CSS directives from a different file, we need to link the HTML file to the CSS file. You can do it by adding this line to the <head> section of your HTML (partial index.erb shown):

````html
<head>
  <link href="/css/application.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
````

This tells the browser that when rendering this web page, it should use the file application.css in the css folder. It also tells the browser that it's a stylesheet (that is, a file that determines what the webpage looks like) and it's of a CSS type.

If you refresh the browser now, you should see your background again. This time it will be defined in an external CSS file.

![browser1](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/browser_1.png)

## Version 3: Adding some logic into the application

Now it's time to add some real content to the website. By now you already have a general understanding of how HTML tags work but if you're confused by anything, please ask.

Let's start by adding the header section with some text to our HTML file. Put this in the `<body>` section of index.erb, deleting what we have there.

````html
<header>
    <h1>Motivational posters</h1>
  </header>
````

Now your webpage should just have one header.

![header](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/motivational_header.png)

Let's add some more content. Let's add the first section on our website. The finished section should look like this.

![kitten_select](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/kitten_select.png)

It will have a header, some text, an input box, a button, an area for search results and Google's branding in the lower right corner (required by the terms and conditions of Google Image Search).

Let's use the `<section>` tag to create section 1. Put this code directly between the closing `</header>` tag and the closing `</body>` tag.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
</section>
````html

It's very similar to the `<header>` element above it but it has two differences. First is that the we're using the `h2` tag for the actual header, instead of `h1`. This will make it a little bit smaller (`h1` is the biggest, `h6` is the smallest). The second difference is that we are giving this section an id of "select-image". The reason is that we'll have several sections and we'll need to differentiate between them later on. We'll be using the id values to refer to elements from CSS files.

Then let's add some text. Let's use the `<p>` tag to add it.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
</section>
````

Now your web page looks like this.

![select_image](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/select_image.png)

Don't worry that it doesn't look exactly like it'll look at the very end. This is because we haven't added the CSS yet. For now let's make sure we have the elements that we need on the page.

Let's now add the input field for our keyword.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
	<input id="search-term" type="text">
</section>
````

The input field that you can type things in is created by the `<input>` tag. There may be many different types of input tags, the one that looks like a search box is the one that has `type="text"`. We also give it an `id`, so that we could add some CSS later.

Once you have added the input fields, add the button. Not surprisingly, you can use the `<button>` tag to do it. As with other elements, let's give it some `id`.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
</section>
````

These are all elements that we'll need to search for images but we don't have any place to display what we'll find. Let's create an empty element for that.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
</section>
````

The `<div>` element is just a generic element without any special significance. Since it's empty, it won't be visible on the page but it's important it exists because we'll be putting the search results in there. Last, but not least, let's add another empty element for Google branding. This is the requirement of Google Image Search.

````html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
  <div id="branding"></div>
</section>
````

So, this is what our application looks like right now.

![select_image_2](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/select_image_2.png)

### Adding some Javascript

Javascript is the programming language that the browser uses. While Ruby is used by your computer (what you run in the Terminal), Javascript is run by your browser right inside of the web page, so you can use it to add dynamic behaviour to your pages.

In this case we'll add some Javascript to fetch the images from Google Image Search and display them on our page.

Let's begin by creating one more folder, `public/javascript`, for our javascript files. Create two files inside: `support.js` and `application.js`.

The first file, `support.js` will contain some javascript that we wrote for you for this project. It is slightly more complex than the other stuff, so we'll leave it until the end. This file does two things: actually performs a Google Image Search and saves the parameters of the form in the url, so we could tweet it later without losing out motivational image (we'll get to this functionality later).

For now just take the contents of this file from [Github](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/support.js) and copy-paste it into the `support.js` file in your project - don't worry about using Copy-Paste just this once :). Leave the `application.js` empty for a moment.

Now let's link our JS files to the HTML file using a very similar technique that we used to link CSS files to HTML. Add these four lines into the `<head>` section of your index.erb.

````html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="/javascript/support.js"></script>        
<script src="/javascript/application.js"></script>
````

Now your `<head>` section looks like this. The first `<script>` tag links to the google server that will actually perform the image search. The second `<script>` tag links to [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a widely used Javascript library that simplified many operations.

````html
<head>
  <link href="/css/application.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">        
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/javascript/support.js"></script>  
  <script src="/javascript/application.js"></script>
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
````

However, even though the code is loaded as part of the page, it's inactive right now because we never executed it. Let's see how we can do it.

We want our images to be found when the user clicks the button. The Javascript way of doing it looks like this:

````javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
});
````

So, what's going on here? In plain English, this should be read like this:

> When an element with the id of "go-search" is clicked in the document, a block of code (function) should be executed that will find images on google using the keyword from the field with id of "search-term" and put them in the area with id of "search-results".

Sounds complex, right? It's actually simpler than it seems. Let's break it down into pieces.

To determine what to do when some event happens, we use this Javascript:

````javascript
$(document).on(event, element, function() {
  // what to do when this event happens on this element
});
````

In this case we want to find images when a "click" event happens on the element with id "go-search". Remember we were giving many elements an `id`? That's exactly what they are needed for: to reference the elements later.

If we want to reference an element by `id`, we just put a hash in front of a name. We call this a **CSS selector**.

So, if we want to do something when a button with a specific id is clicked, we write:

````javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  // the action to execute
});
````

Now, what do we want to happen? We want to search Google Images for a given keyword and show the results. Remember we created an input field for the keyword?

````html
<input id="search-term" type="text">
````

It has the `id="search-term"`, so we can reference it using this id to get it's value. To do this, we can use this piece of Javascript.

````javascript
$('#search-term').val()
````

This code means "Take element with id of 'search-term' and give me its value, that is, what's typed inside".

Where do we put the results? Again, remember we created a special area for them?

````html
<div id="search-results"></div>
````

As you can probably guess by now, we can reference this area like this.

````javascript
$("#search-results")
````

Now we have everything we need to tell our browser to get the images from Google and show the results.

````javascript
findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
````

This code asks the browser to go find images on google using whatever is typed into `#search-term` and put the results into `#search-results`. Makes sense?

Now, let's put it all together, so that this code was executed only when the button was pressed.

````javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
});
````

Now put the code above into application.js and save the file. Refresh your browser, enter the search term and you'll see the results!

![browser2](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/day_one/browser_2.png)

Impressive, isn't it? Especially that we did very little work to achieve this result.

It still doesn't look exactly like we want it to look at the very end but we'll fix it soon.

## Version 4: Final touches and "getting it out there"

## Extra Exercises

Finally, once you are really comfortable with the existing codebase, do the following exercises. Many of them will involve some googling around to learn something new, others will involve going back to this tutorial, as well as HTML & CSS overview.

- Add more colours into the drop-down menu. Make sure there are lots of colours to choose from.
- Change the background colours of the sections to something new, don't use the colours we've just used. Play with the opacity values.
- When the thumbnails are shown, they look rather dull: all together, without borders or shadows, without any space in between. How can you make them look better?
- When you enter the keyword and press Enter, the search isn't performed by default. What if you add a Javascript event to listen for when you hit "Enter" in the keyword input field? Then, when this event happens, you could kick off the image search. You'll probably need to google a little bit to find out how to listen for this event (stackoverflow.com is the best source of programming tips).
- Right now we're using Helvetica as the font for the page. Find out how to use a different font. What fonts are available in every browser by default? Change the font to one of them.
- Can you find out how to download an exotic font, add it to the project and apply only to the h1 header on the page using CSS?
Right now the "Powered by Google" logo is right-aligned. Can you make it centred?
- Add your name to the footer, so that everyone knew who built this site!
- In the footer we're listing the technologies used. Can you find their websites and add the links in the footer?
- We've got the tweet button on the page that we've got from the Twitter website. Can you find the code for the Facebook like page? (This may be a bit tricky, it may involve creating an "application" on Facebook but it's actually much easier than it sounds).
- What other text properties, apart from position, colour, alignment and font size can you think of? Can you add them to the page and make them work with javascript?
- Find a website that allows you to generate a logo, create one for the page and add as an image to the header.
- Find a website that allows you to generate buttons, create a beautiful "Search" button and replace our plain and dull "Go" button.
