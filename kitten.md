# First day? Let's do something just for fun!

Welcome to Makers Academy! Are you ready for the ride?

Today we are going to take things slow, we want you to have some fun before we start working through the material of this course and begin our journey; we want to give you a glimpse of what it will feel like to be a software developer!

We'll build a website that allows you to create a motivational poster using an image and text that the user inputs.

This is what the website will look like when you build it.

You're strongly encouraged to type in all code instead of copy-pasting it. This will really help your understanding of how everything works.

We can't stress this enough. Copy and Paste is the DEVIL!! Even though at times you will be copying chunks of code, the simple process of typing it yourself will help you learn. Trust us. You can't cut corners.

## What you'll need

- [Google Chrome browser](http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/). It's very well suited to web development ( _Safari; bundled with your Mac will do fine as well though_ ).
- [SublimeText editor](http://www.sublimetext.com). This is a very convenient text editor that we'll be using.
- Make sure you know how to run Terminal (it's already installed on every Mac). Find it in your Applications (in the Utilities folder) and launch it. ![finder](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/finder.png)
- XCode command line tools. Go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/, click "View downloads" under Xcode 5 section, enter your Apple ID (you use it to get content from AppStore or iTunes), create one if you don't have it, select "Command Line tools for OS X Mountain Lion XCode5", download and follow the installation instructions.![finder](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/command_line_tools.png)
- Once you have installed XCode, install Heroku Toolbelt from https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ 
- Install RVM. 
Type this in the Terminal window.

```
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.0.0
```
