# SOLID Principles
## O - Open/Closed Principle
* Explain what "an object should be open for extension, but closed for modification" means
* Give reasons why the Open/Closed Principle makes for more easily extensible applications

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* Paraphrase "functions that are designed to operate on _objects of a given class_ should work when they operate on _objects of a subclass of that class_"
* Explain why the Liskov Substitution Principle makes for more predictable application structures

## I - Interface Segregation Principle
* Define an interface as a way to interact with application objects
* Remember that SOLID code should avoid interfaces requiring objects to be of a specific type
* Link 'duck typing' with avoiding Interface Segregation Principle violations
