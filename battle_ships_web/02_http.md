# The Hypertext Transfer Protocol

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

As we have seen, the web is a system of clients and servers talking to each other. But how do they talk to each other? Usually, clients and servers talk to each other using the HyperText Transfer Protocol. A client makes a **request** to a server and gets back a **response**. It is called a "protocol" because it has a defined structure for requests and responses.

In this challenge you will look at the important elements of an HTTP request and response.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Understand what request and response **headers** are.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Use cURL's "-v" flag and make a request to 'http://curl.haxx.se/'.
- [ ] Divide what you see into three sections:
  - [ ] The request headers. 
  - [ ] The response headers.
  - [ ] The **body** of the response.
- [ ] For each of the above, explain to your partner which side of the client-server relationship they originate from.
