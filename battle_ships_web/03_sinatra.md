# Sinatra: Defining a Second Route

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

So far we've defined a single route, '/', that responds with a HTTP message containing "Hello, World!".

In this challenge you will add a second route. By adding a second route we will see that routes, distinct entry points to an application, activate different server actions and so return different responses.

Additionally, we will use **shotgun** to speed up our development process.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Define a route in Sinatra
- Use Shotgun

### Challenge setup

> Challenge setups are optional. Use them if there's more stuff to get setup than you want to put in the introduction.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Define a second route, `get '/foobar'`. Have it respond with a message of your choosing.
- [ ] Visit the new route in the browser. Do you see the message?
- [ ] Kill the app on the command line with ctrl-c and run it again.
- [ ] Run your application using the shotgun gem.
- [ ] Define a few more routes. Without killing the server, check if the routes are visitable.
