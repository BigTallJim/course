# Sinatra 01

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

So far we've explored HTTP, a means of communicating across the web. A **web framework** is a program that receives HTTP requests and responds in kind. There are many web frameworks available in Ruby. Two of the most popular are Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. For this week, we will use Sinatra for the reason that its simplicity allows us to focus on fundamentals.

This challenge introduces the basics of Sinatra, including defining **routes**.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Create a Sinatra application.
- Define a **route** on your application.
- Run the Sinatra app.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Install the Sinatra gem.
- [ ] Create a file for your application, `app.rb`.
- [ ] Require Sinatra at the top of the file.
- [ ] Use the Sinatra method, `get`, to define a **route** that displays the words "Hello, World!"
- [ ] Run the app from the command line: `ruby app.rb`.
- [ ] Check that it works by visiting your application in the browser.
