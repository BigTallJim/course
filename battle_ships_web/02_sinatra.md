# Sinatra: Hello World

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

So far we've explored HTTP, a means of communicating across the web. A **web framework** is a program that receives HTTP requests and responds in kind. There are a number of web frameworks written in Ruby. Two of the most popular are Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. This week we will use Sinatra as its simplicity allows us to focus on fundamentals.

In this challenge, you will define your first Sinatra **route**.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Create a Sinatra application.
- Define a **route** on your application.
- Run the Sinatra app locally.

### Challenge setup

For this challenge you will need a Gemfile listing Sinatra as a dependency.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Create a project directory with the Sinatra gem installed via a Gemfile
- [ ] Create a file for your application, `app.rb`.
- [ ] Require `sinatra` at the top of the file.
- [ ] Use the Sinatra method, `get`, to define a '/' **route** that responds with the words "Hello, World!"
- [ ] Run the app from the command line: `ruby app.rb`.
- [ ] Explain to your partner the significance of what you see in the terminal
- [ ] Check that your route works by visiting your application in the browser at the correct address.
- [ ] Are you able to visit your application from a different computer?
