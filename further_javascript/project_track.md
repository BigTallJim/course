# Project track

For this track, there's almost no structure.

You'll work in unchanging groups of about four for the whole week.

## Structure of the week

### Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday

Take [user stories for a to do list app](to_do_list_app_user_stories.md).  Use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

Extract your own web framework from your app.

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

### Thursday and Friday

(If it's getting late into the week and you haven't started the news summarising app, don't rush through it.  Refactor your to do list app and your web framework.)

Use your extracted framework to build an [app that summarises the news](news_summary_project.md).

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

## Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance](guidance.md)! It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.
