# Project track

You'll work in unchanging **teams of about four** for the whole week.

You'll **implement user stories** for a note-taking app.  No challenges, no walkthroughs.

And you'll implement user stories for an app that summarises the news.  No challenges, no walkthroughs.

## Structure of the week

### Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday

Take [user stories for a notes app](notes_app_user_stories.md).  Use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

You may not use any existing web frameworks, libraries or even a test library (e.g. Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery).

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

#### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance on building a frontend, single page app](frontend_single_page_app_guidance.md)! It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.

#### Test library

Extract your own test library from your app.  See here for more [guidance on testing without a testing library and extracting your testing code into its own library](../pills/writing_tests_without_a_testing_library.md).

### Thursday and Friday

Build an [app that summarises the news](news_summary_project.md).

You may not use any existing web frameworks or libraries (e.g. Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery).  (But you can use your new testing library!)

No challenges.  No walkthroughs.

(If it's getting late into the week and you haven't started the news summarising app, don't rush through it.  Refactor your notes app and your test library.)
