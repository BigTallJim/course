# Challenge track

There is some structure to guide you on this track.

You'll work in pairs as usual, swapping pairs each day.

## Structure of the week

### Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday

Build a to do list app as a frontend, single page web app.  You'll be guided through this by the high level challenges listed below.  However, there will be no walkthroughs.

#### Challenges

1. [Use Mocha to unit test and write a model for a to do](01_to_do_model.md)
2. [Unit test and write a model for a to do list](02_to_do_list_model.md)
3. [Unit test and write some code that outputs a to do list model as HTML](03_output_to_do_list_as_html.md)
4. [Play around to create and serve an `index.html` page for your app](04_index_page.md)
5. [Use Zombie.js to write a feature test that tests that your app displays a title](05_zombie_set_up_and_app_title.md)
6. [Write a feature test that checks that a to do is displayed in the `index.html` page](06_display_to_do_in_page.md)
7. [Play around to add a form for creating a to do to `index.html`](07_create_to_do_form.md)
8. [Play around to intercept a form `submit` event emitted by the form that creates a to do](08_intercept_submit_event.md) (events, form handling, preventDefault)
9. [Play around to extract a task from a `submit` event](09_extract_form_data_from_submit_event.md)
10. [Test and write code that takes a task from a `submit` event and creates a to do](10_user_create_to_do.md) (talk about feature vs unit testing and abstracting, make sure test includes to do appearing in page)
11. [Test and write code that implements a to do `Complete` button](11_complete_button.md)
12. [Use Ajax to request some to dos stored on a remote server; display them](12_request_to_dos_with_ajax.md)
13. [Refactor](13_refactor.md)

### Thursday and Friday

Build a [frontend, single page web app that summarises the news](news_summary_project.md).  No challenges.  No walkthroughs.  You'll be able to build on what you've learnt from making the to do list app.

#### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance](guidance.md) for the news summariser app!  It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things. (The guidance shouldn't be necessary for the to do app.  The challenges will guide you with that.)
