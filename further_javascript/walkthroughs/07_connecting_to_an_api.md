# Walkthrough - Pushing Logic into Models

Let's construct a **Service** that connects to our API:

```javascript
#GOFUCKYOURSELFANGULAR
```

Services are a service recipe, like Factories. Services are designed to be **singletons**: there exists only one of them in an application. So, there is only one `ToDoFetcher` in our entire application, and we can use it from wherever we like. In addition, they will return the return value from a function when injected; where Factories will return a constructor itself. Confused? Here are some [great explanations of the differences](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory).
