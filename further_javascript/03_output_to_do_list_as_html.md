# Unit test and write some code that outputs a to do list model as HTML

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In order to display a list of to dos to the user, they need to be converted to HTML.  In this challenge, you'll write code that outputs a to do list model as an unordered HTML list.

You could create the HTML through string concatenation, or use the Mustache templating library.

### Learning objectives covered

- Generate HTML for an unordered list.
- Implement a simple dynamic template.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write tests that check you take a to do list model and return a string of HTML that structures the to dos as an unordered HTML list.  For example, `<ul><li><div>Eat breakfast</div></li></ul>`.
- [ ] Write code to pass the tests.  (Interesting question: where does this code belong? In ToDoList? In its own module?)

> NB: This challenge doesn't require you to display the HTML in a browser, or put the HTML into an HTML file.  If the code you write to pass the tests returns the right string of HTML, the challenge is complete!
