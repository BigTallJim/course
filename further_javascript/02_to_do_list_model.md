# Unit test and write a model for a to do list

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll test and write code for a model that holds a list of to dos.

### Learning objectives covered

- Write tests with Mocha.
- Use the constructor and prototype pattern to implement a model for a list of to dos.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write tests that check you can instantiate a JavaScript object that represents a list of to do objects.  Write tests to check that you can give the to do list object a string like `Eat breakfast` and it will store a new to do object.
- [ ] Implement a to do list model that passes the tests.
