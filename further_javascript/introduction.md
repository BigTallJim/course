# Researching, understanding and using new technologies in JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Do you have an effective process for researching, understanding and using new technologies?**

* Your secondary aim is to answer "yes" with some confidence to the question, "Can I build a frontend, single page web app?"

### Concepts and concretes

You'll create two frontend, [single page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) web apps.  You'll learn about events and manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).  You'll deepen your understanding of Ajax and JavaScript.  And you'll learn about frontend versions of familiar concepts like templating and routing.

## Tracks

This week is composed of separate tracks.  You'll choose one and stay on it for the whole week.

* The [challenge track](00_challenge_track.md) has some structure to guide you, but less than normal.
* The [project track](project_track.md) has almost no structure.

## Get started

Have a look at the materials for each track.  Choose which one you want to do.  Once you get your pair or group assignment, you can get started.

It's going to be exciting!
