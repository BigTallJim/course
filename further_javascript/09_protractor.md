# Setting up and running protractor

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

To start testing you're going to need to do a bit more setup. First of all we're
going to use [protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) for running
our feature tests (called end-to-end tests by Angular). Protractor is a bit like
capybara, but it uses a programme called Selenium to open up an actual browser
and run your tests in that.

Don't forget to do this challenge test-first!

### Learning Objectives covered
- Install protractor
- Run Angular using `http-server`
- Running Angular feature tests using Protractor

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Install Protractor
- [ ] Create a simple test that checks for "Hello world" on the page
- [ ] Serve up angular using `http-server`
- [ ] Set up `index.html` with a title of "Todos App", and load in an angular
  module called `toDoApp`
- [ ] Get a green feature test
