# Test and write code that takes a task from a `submit` event and creates a to do

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll write code to let the user submit a new to do.  You'll test that the new to do appears in the page.  You might also refactor your code so that its concerns are better separated into modules, rather than it all being in `index.js`.  If you do this, it will make your code easier to test and more agile.

### Learning objectives covered

- Write a more complex feature test that encompasses a user filling out and submitting a form and seeing new data displayed in a page.
- Use Zombie to verify several parts of the content of a web page.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write a feature test that checks that the user can submit the create task form and that their new task is displayed in the `index.html` page.
- [ ] Optional.  Redesign the code in your `index.js` code into several separate modules, each with a single responsibility.  Write unit tests to test these units.  Write code to pass the tests.
- [ ] Write code to make your feature test pass.
