# Presentation Guidelines

* You'll have 5 minutes to present. It's not that long, but you don't have to use all the time if you don't want to.

* Try to practice your presentation at least once, but don't spend ages polishing it.

* If you'd like to show your app working, prepare a short video that demos it.  The video doesn't have to be polished - just a screen movie of someone using the app is great.

* Focus your presentation on the four parts of the assessment criteria:

### Tests
* Evidence of your test suite

### Quality
* Evidence of good quality

### Development
* Evidence of git workflow
* Good documentation of project in the README.md
* CI & deployment

### Learning
* Evidence of how the team learned
* Technical or teamwork struggles you overcame
