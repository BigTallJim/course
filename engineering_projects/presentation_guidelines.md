# Presentation Guidelines

* You'll have 5 minutes to present.

* Try to practice your presentation at least once, but don't spend ages polishing it.

* Focus your presentation on the four parts of the [assessment criteria](./assessment_criteria.md)

- a snapshot of your test coverage and quality
- your deployment pipeline
- how you documented your learning and worked as a team

* Please demo a user using your app!
