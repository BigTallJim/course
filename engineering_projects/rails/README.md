# Project: Acebook

For this project you will be working in teams to produce a social media platform.

**Important:** There are a number of large features that will need to be broken down into smaller tickets and estimated before they are assigned to a pair to complete.

Each team will start with the same project seed and virtual card-wall with some initial tickets to get you started.
