# Engineering Project

## Pathways

- [rails](rails/README.md)


## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goals

By the end of the engineering project, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the primary question:

* **Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?**


## What is a successful project?

This is not a test, nor a challenge to see how many features you can cram into the application.

**Far more important** is to consider:
   - how you are learning
   - how you are writing code
   - how you are working together as a team using Agile methodologies.
   - whether you have an understanding of a deployment pipeline

## [Project Schedule](./week_schedule.md)


## Project Blog

- Nominate a team member
- Create an account at medium.com and then create a blog for your team and slack a project coach with the URL.
- Rotate team members to create daily posts: keep a record of what you learn and get blocked on

## Standups and retros

Morning stand-ups and daily retrospectives in your teams.

## Weekend challenge

At the end of the 1st week of the project there's a challenge for each pathway. Use it as always: a tool to help you self-assess your understanding. There won't be a cohort review on the following Monday.

## Presentations

At the end of the project, each team will present the great work done!  They will talk through a very simple slide deck and do a quick demo of their project.  There's no need to spend ages planning or practising the presentation.  It's mainly to communicate about your learning, technical achievements, and show off your cool project to the rest of your cohort.

- [guidelines](./presentation_guidelines.md) to follow when planning your presentation.
