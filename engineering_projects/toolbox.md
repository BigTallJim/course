#### - We have this ticket, but we don't know where to start on it.

- Spend some time investigating how to approach it.
- List out the things that need to be done, try to list them out in as small a piece as possible
- Prioritise them:
  - do some things have to be completed before others can be worked on?
  - can some things be not-done/are unnecessary?
- Create individual tickets for all of them, and put them in the right list.
- Choose the smallest and easiest ticket first

#### - We've finished our ticket, now we don't know what to do next

0. In the Unestimated list, split a big ticket into smaller tickets if needed.
1. Estimate how long the tickets will take
2. Move them to To Do list once estimated
3. Choose a ticket to work on from To Do and move to In Progress
4. Complete Ticket
5. Move it to Review
6. Check with team for review (what is your review process?)
7. Merge to master if needed
8. Move to Done
9. Repeat from 3. Or from 1 if none are left

#### - We're finding pairing difficult in our team

- honest communication is a skill everyone can improve on
- normalise giving feedback
  - when you pair share feedback often, at least twice a day
    - morning and afternoon, or after every feature
  - facilitate a feedback session in every retrospective
    - first theme can be about pairing expectations
- set timers for role switching, and timers for pairing sessions.
  - 1hr pairing in 15 min sessions before switching roles.

#### - We're not sure we're learning much without a tutorial

- diagram your understanding of rails
- build a small rails app
- follow the flow of data in a req/res cycle for a process like going to the homepage/submitting a form
- take notes on your understanding
- explain it to someone else
