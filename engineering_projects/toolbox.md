I have this ticket, but I don't know where to start.

- Spend some time investigating how to approach it.
- List out the things that need to be done, try to list them out in as small a piece as possible
- Prioritise them:
  - do some things have to be completed before others can be worked on?
  - can some things be not-done/are unnecessary?
- Create individual tickets for all of them, and put them in the right list.
- Choose the smallest and easiest ticket first

I don't know what to do next

- Tickets on the to do list, make sure they are estimated
- Tickets on the Unestimated list
  - estimate a few, choose a small ticket to do
  - find a big ticket and break it down

I'm finding pairing difficult in my team

- honest communication is a skill everyone can improve on
- normalise giving feedback
  - when you pair share feedback often, at least twice a day
    - morning and afternoon, or after every feature
  - facilitate a feedback session in every retrospective
    - first theme can be about pairing expectations
- set timers for role switching, and timers for pairing sessions.
  - 1hr pairing in 15 min sessions before switching roles.

I'm not sure I'm learning much without a tutorial

- diagram your understanding of rails
- build a small rails app
- follow the flow of data in a req/res cycle for a process like going to the homepage/submitting a form
- take notes on your understanding
- explain it to someone else
