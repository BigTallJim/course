#Individual technical challenges

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code?**

By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested and follows Kent Beck's 4 rules of simple design.

#### Secondary goals

By the end of the week, you should:

* Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.
* Be able to discuss your code using more technical language, and with a wider vocabulary.

### Structure of the week

Each day, you'll work solo to complete a diffeent technical challenge.

* 9.30am (except Monday): We'll reflect briefly on the previous day's challenge.  Then your coach will announce the day's technical challenge.
* 9.30am - 5.30pm: You'll work solo on the day's technical challenge.
* At 5.30pm, you'll review your code in pairs.
* At 6pm, we'll review code as a group.

#### Monday
* [Database server](database_server.md)
* Technical interview practice

#### Tuesday
* [Bank tech test](bank_tech_test.md)

#### Wednesday
* [tic-tac-toe](tic_tac_toe.md)
* Technical interview practice

#### Thursday
* [Gilded rose tech test](gilded_rose.md)

#### Friday
* [Till tech test](till_tech_test.md)

Enjoy these challenges - they are either adapted or directly copied from actual tech tests that employers send out. You will find other tech tests in this folder that you can attempt over the weekend or after graduation.
