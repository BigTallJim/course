#Individual technical challenges

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code?**

By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.

#### Secondary goals

By the end of the week, you should:

* Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.
* Be able to discuss your code using more technical language, and with a wider vocabulary.

### Structure of the week

Each day, you'll work solo to complete a diffeent technical challenge.

* 9.30am (except Monday): We'll reflect briefly on the previous day's challenge.  Then your coach will announce the day's technical challenge.
* 9.30am - 5.30pm: You'll work solo on the day's technical challenge.
* At 5.30pm, you'll review your code in pairs.
* At 6pm, we'll review code as a group.

### Interviews

There will be two sessions where we get together as a group to practice technical interview questions and technical language.

### Processes

Focus on your process - each day should be a practice not just of that new problem, but problem solving in general.

### Challenges

Enjoy these challenges - they are either adapted or directly copied from actual tech tests that employers send out. You will find other tech tests in this folder that you can attempt over the weekend or after graduation.

* Technical interview practice

#### Tuesday

* [Bank tech test](bank_tech_test.md)

#### Wednesday
