Lab Week
========

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

The purpose of lab week is to help students develop further as self directed learners, taking the practices of planning, standups and retrospectives from the first five weeks and using them to achieve their own goals in terms of small projects and consolidation of the existing material.

During lab week coaches are generally not available as they are conducting their own retrospective and planning activities related to developing the course and related materials.  To help with planning and retrospectives coaches will usually be available for Monday 9am and Friday 9am standups, as well as spending significant time with students on the Friday before lab week helping the students plan lab week activities.

It is very important that Lab week is not seen as a time to take a holiday.  One of the dangers of Lab week is that it is started with the best of intentions.  "I'll work from home, on my own, catch up on the challenges I didn't complete".  The danger is that even with the best of intentions, real life intrudes.  It is critical to spend as much time at the office as possible, or if you must be remote, then at the very least that you are participating in regular standups with your peers at least twice a day.

The second half of the Makers Academy course requires serious dedication and commitment.  You must use Lab Week to ensure that you have solid foundation for the second half of the course.
