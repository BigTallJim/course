Lab Week
========

### What is Lab Week?
Lab Week is one of the most important weeks at Makers Academy. It marks your transition from the first half of the course - where the main concepts and technologies are introduced - to the second half of the course, where these are applied in increasingly more project-based scenarios. Lab week is a self-directed time to:

- review the material covered so far, or
- build something new with those technologies, or
- explore a new technology.

### How should I approach Lab Week?
It is entirely up to you how you approach Lab Week but we strongly recommend:
- That you be at Makers Academy from **9AM, Monday through Friday**.
- That you work in a team of 4 - 6, pair with members of your team, and run twice-daily stand-ups within your team. 
- Coordinate on Slack (e.g. in private groups)
- Focus on a particular topic or project on each day. Donâ€™t try to review / learn everything. Spending the whole week mastering CSS is better than getting half way through 4 different walkthroughs / tutorials.

### What support can I expect during Lab Week?
During lab week coaches are generally not available as they are conducting their own retrospective and planning activities related to developing the course and related materials.  To help with planning and retrospectives, some coaches may be available for Monday 9am and Friday 9am stand-ups.  We will also help scaffold the planning of lab week activities where required.

### Objectives
There are some project-based [learning objectives](learning_objectives.md), but you should create a set of learning objectives of your own at the start of lab week.  This will help you to review your progress.  You should also create a git repository to contain the code and/or documents created during the week.

###Tips:
Review the [escalation process](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/escalation_process.md) and use [slack-overflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow) to get issues resolved.
