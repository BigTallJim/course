# Solution - Using Data Mapper

[Back to Challenge](../06_using_data_mapper.md)

Keep your psql prompt open but open a new tab in terminal. Create a Gemfile and add the following gems:
```ruby
gem 'data_mapper'
gem 'dm-postgres-adapter'
```

Bundle install then crack open IRB or pry and run the following:

```ruby
require 'data_mapper'
require 'dm-postgres-adapter'
DataMapper::Logger.new($stdout, :debug)
DataMapper.setup(:default, "postgres://localhost/database_play")
```

The above are pretty self-explanatory. For learning purposes, we're having DataMapper show us its chatter with the database.

Now let's create a Student "model" (within IRB) for interfacing with our student table in the database:

```ruby
class Student
  include DataMapper::Resource

  property :id,     Serial
  property :name,   String
end
```

So we've created a class that has extra abilities endowed by DataMapper: namely, the ability to persist data to the database. We now need to have DataMapper [check the validity](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/datamapper/dm-core/DataMapper/Model#finalize-instance_method) of the models as we've declared them.
```ruby
DataMapper.finalize
```

DataMapper decorates the #new method for creating instances and preserving their data within the database:

```ruby
Student.create(name: "Ptolemy")
```

The Logger we setup will give us a bunch of mostly uninteresting chatter, but it should include the line:

```psql
~ (0.001957) INSERT INTO "students" ("name") VALUES ('Ptolemy') RETURNING "id"
```

So we've achieved exactly what we did before but in a single line of nice familiar Ruby.

We can also search for students and delete them and anything else that we can do via SQL can be done with DataMapper.

```ruby
student = Student.find(name: 'Ptolemy').first
student.destroy
~ (0.003726) DELETE FROM "students" WHERE "id" = 1
```
