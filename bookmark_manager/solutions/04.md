# Solution - Creating Your First Table

[Back to Challenge](../04_creating_your_first_table.md)

NOTE: The dollar symbol represents a command prompt. DON'T actually type the dollar symbol in this case!

Assuming you have psql installed and working, connect to your pool of databases like so:

    $ psql

Which should give you a command prompt:

    psql (9.3.5)
    Type "help" for help.

    admin=#

It's important to note that there's two ways of interacting with the `psql` console. Commands beginning with a `\` are Postgres specific commands (e.g. connecting to databases `\c`). Everything else is part of SQL (e.g. `SELECT * FROM ...`).

Let's have a look at the existing databases:

    $ \l

You probably won't have any existing databases. Let's create a new one:

    $ CREATE DATABASE database_play;

We can now connect to the newly created database:

    $ \c database_play;

And inspect the existing list of tables:

    $ \dt

    No relations found.

That makes sense as we haven't put any data into this database or even told it how it should be structured. Here's how we create a table for storing data about students with SQL commands:

    CREATE TABLE students(
      id serial PRIMARY KEY,
      name varchar(50)
    );

Now if we inspect the list of tables again (see above) we should see one with the name students.
