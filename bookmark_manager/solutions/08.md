# Solution

[Back to Challenge](../08_viewing_links.md)

As you'd do with every new project, create a new repository on Github.  

* Name your project 'bookmark_manager'.
* From your project directory, run `bundle init` to generate a Gemfile.
* In the Gemfile:
  - specify the version of Ruby that you wish to use.
  - make a test group and add `gem 'rspec'` and `gem 'capybara'`
* Run `bundle`.
* Add `require 'capybara/rspec'` to your spec_helper.rb (use `rspec --init` if you're not comfortable creating your own spec_helper).
* Commit the changes, push them to Github and switch Driver/Navigator Roles&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:

This is how we would approach this in a Glass Box style of testing.

```ruby
feature 'Viewing links' do

  scenario 'I can see existing links on the links page' do
    Link.new(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')

    visit '/links'

    # as this is our first feature test,
    # the following expectation is a quick check that everything is working.
    expect(page.status_code).to eq 200
    # you might remove this later.

    # why do we use within here?
    # might we get a false positive if we just test for 'Makers Academy'?
    within 'ul#links' do
      expect(page).to have_content('Makers Academy')
    end
  end
end
```

We could have also tested this by using Capybara to fill in a form for creating the link,
which is a valid approach, however for the purposes of moving through the challenge sequence
we'll be working with the above style to introduce database concepts earlier.
