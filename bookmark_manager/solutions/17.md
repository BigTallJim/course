# Solution

[Back to Challenge](../17_multiple_tags.md)

Let's write a test for multiple tags `adding_tags_spec.rb`:

```ruby
scenario 'I can add multiple tags to a new link' do
  visit '/links/new'
  fill_in 'url',   with: 'http://www.makersacademy.com/'
  fill_in 'title', with: 'Makers Academy'
  # our tags will be space separated
  fill_in 'tags',  with: 'education ruby'
  click_button 'Create link'
  link = Link.first
  expect(link.tags.map(&:name)).to include('education', 'ruby')
end
```

So this should fail like so:

```
1) Adding tags I can add multiple tags to a new link
    Failure/Error: fill_in 'tags',  with: 'education ruby'
    Capybara::ElementNotFound:
      Unable to find field "tags"
```

First up we should ensure that the form specifies we are submitting multiple tags:

```html
<label for='tags'>
   Tag:
   <input type='text' name='tags' />
 </label>
```

Which leads to two failures, since the older single tag test will fail with:

```
Failure/Error: fill_in 'tag', with: 'education'
    Capybara::ElementNotFound:
      Unable to find field "tag"
```

and the new test will fail with

```
Failure/Error: expect(link.tags.map(&:name)).to include('education', 'ruby')
     expected [nil] to include "education" and "ruby"
```

First up we carefully fix the old test like so:

```ruby
 fill_in 'tags', with: 'education'
```

which takes us back to a single failing test, which we can fix like so:

```ruby

post '/links' do
   link = Link.create(url: params[:url], title: params[:title])
   params[:tags].split.each do |tag|
     link.tags << Tag.create(name: tag)
   end
   link.save
   redirect to('/links')
 end
```

Doing so should make your tests go green.  Now check the functionality locally in the browser and deploy to heroku.

1. We'll need to add the rake gem to the Gemfile
2. We'll need to add a file called 'Rakefile' to the root
3. That file should contain the following:

```ruby
require 'data_mapper'

task :before do
  raise "RAKE_ENV has not been specified" unless ENV.has_key?('RACK_ENV')
end

namespace :db do
  desc "do it on test"
  task :test do
    ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test'
  end

  desc "do it on development"
  task :development do
    ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'development'
  end
end

desc "Non destructive upgrade"
task :auto_upgrade => [:before] do
  # auto_upgrade makes non-destructive changes.
  # If your tables don't exist, they will be created
  # but if they do and you changed your schema
  # (e.g. changed the type of one of the properties)
  # they will not be upgraded because that'd lead to data loss.

  require './app/data_mapper_setup'
  DataMapper.auto_upgrade!
  puts "Auto-upgrade complete (no data loss)"
end


desc "Destructive upgrade"
task :auto_migrate => [:before] do
  # To force the creation of all tables as they are
  # described in your models, even if this
  # leads to data loss, use auto_migrate:

  require './app/data_mapper_setup'
  DataMapper.auto_migrate!
  puts "Auto-migrate complete (data was lost)"
end
# Finally, don't forget that before you do any of that stuff,
# you need to create a database first.

task :test do
  system "rspec 2>/dev/null"
end
```

and you will then be able to control your database migrations and upgrades via the command line, e.g.:

```
$ rake db:test auto_upgrade
$ rake db:development auto_upgrade
```

and on Heroku:

```
$ heroku run rake db:test auto_upgrade
$ heroku run rake db:development auto_upgrade
```

Finally please don't forget to remove  DataMapper.auto_migrate! and/or DataMapper.auto_upgrade! from `./app/data_mapper_setup`
