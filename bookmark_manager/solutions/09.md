# Solution

[Back to Challenge](../09_creating_a_link_model.md)

Let's create the first model in `/app/models/link.rb`.

```ruby
require 'data_mapper'
require 'dm-postgres-adapter'

# This class corresponds to a table in the database
# We can use it to manipulate the data
class Link

  # adds datamapper functionality to this class
  include DataMapper::Resource

  # these property declarations set the column headers in the Link table
  property :id,     Serial # Serial means that it will be auto-incremented for every record
  property :title,  String
  property :url,    String

end

DataMapper.setup(:default, "postgres://localhost/bookmark_manager_test")
DataMapper.finalize
DataMapper.auto_upgrade!
```

This class prescribes a relationship between a table in the database (which will be called 'links') and the `Link` class. An instance of the `Link` class represents a row of the 'links' table.

Also make sure to require the link model in your `spec_helper`

```
# spec/spec_helper.rb

require './app/models/link'

...
```

Note that spec_helper will be required automatically in your spec via the `.rspec` file

Running our tests now should kick up the following error:
```rspec

 1) Viewing links I can see existing links on the links page
