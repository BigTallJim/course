# Solution - Manipulating Table Data

[Back to Challenge](../05_manipulating_table_data.md)

 Let's list all the existing students:

    $ SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;

This command displays all columns from the table "students" and shows us an empty table:

    id | name
    ----+------
    (0 rows)

Let's add some data:

    $ INSERT INTO students (name)
    VALUES ('Ptolemy');

Let's add some more:

    $ INSERT INTO students (name)
    VALUES ('Stefan');

The same select command from above will prove that the new data has been added to the students table.

To delete one we can do the following:

    $ DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Stefan';

To update we can do this:

    UPDATE students SET name = 'Stefan' WHERE name = 'Ptolemy';
