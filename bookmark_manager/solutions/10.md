Prior to adding the `\links` path you should see this error if you have Sinatra set up:

```
Failures:

 1) Viewing links I can see existing links on the links page
    Failure/Error: expect(page.status_code).to eq 200

      expected: 200
           got: 404

      (compared using ==)
    # ./spec/features/listing_all_links_spec.rb:6:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.02297 seconds (files took 0.693 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

You are receiving a status code of 404 - which indicates that the path does not exist.

In your `app/app.rb` you can create the links path by adding

```ruby
# /app/app.rb
require 'sinatra/base'
require_relative 'models/link'

class BookmarkManager < Sinatra::Base
  get '/links' do
    @links = Link.all
    erb :'links/index'
  end
end
```

And in your view you can have

```html
<!-- in views/links/index.erb -->
<h1> Links </h1>

<ul id='links'>
  <% @links.each do |link| %>
    <li>
      Title: <%= link.title %>
      URL:   <%= link.url   %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Here's how your spec_helper should look:

```ruby
require 'capybara/rspec'
require './app/app'
Capybara.app = BookmarkManager
```

Your feature test should now pass.
