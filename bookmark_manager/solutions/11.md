# Solution

[Back to Challenge](../11_creating_links.md)

`creating_links_spec.rb` should look something like this:

```ruby
feature 'Creating links' do

  scenario 'I can create a new link' do
    visit '/links/new'
    fill_in 'url',   with: 'http://www.zombo.com/'
    fill_in 'title', with: 'This is Zombocom'
    click_button 'Create link'

    # we expect to be redirected back to the links page
    expect(current_path).to eq '/links'

    within 'ul#links' do
      expect(page).to have_content('This is Zombocom')
    end
  end
end
```

The above test should fail as follows:

```sh
Failure/Error: fill_in 'url', with: 'http://www.zombo.com'
Capybara::ElementNotFound:
  Unable to find field "url"
````

Define a GET '/links/new' route in app.rb

```ruby
get '/links/new' do
  erb :'links/new'
end
```

Create an associated view containing a form that POSTs to `/links` in `views/links/new.erb`

```html
<h1> New Link </h1>

<form action='/links' method='POST'>
  <label for='title'>
    Title:
    <input type='text' name='title' />
  </label>
  <label for='url'>
    URL:
    <input type='text' name='url' />
  </label>
  <input type='submit' value='Create link'>

</form>
```

Though we have a form for creating links, nothing is being done with the information the user has submitted. Examine the form you just created. Can you guess what path the form data is submitted to?

Within app.rb, define a route for the form data to be submitted to, like so:

```ruby
post '/links' do
  Link.create(url: params[:url], title: params[:title])
  redirect to('/links')
end
```

As to why we POST to /links and not /links/new; and why do we GET links/new. Notice that the message structure help us to infer the intent of each message.  We are following RESTful principles here that GET links should return a list of links, while POST links should create a new link, while GET links/new is getting a new form.  POST links/new doesn't have a consistent meaning from a RESTful perspective.
