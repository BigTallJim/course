## Viewing Links

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Now you have a mockup and a few user stories you're ready to start building out the functionality.

The BDD cycle suggests we should always start with a feature test. Last week we saw how to feature test web apps using Capybara.

In this challenge you will be creating a feature test for the user story of a link being displayed, e.g.

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of links on the homepage
```

## Learning Objectives covered

* Use Capybara to create feature tests that include database functionality

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Setup a project named `bookmark_manager` with a Gemfile and RSpec/Capybara set up
- [ ] Write a feature test for the first user story
- [ ] The feature test must fail

## Resources

* datamapper
* three tier web Architecture
* glass vs black box testing
* capybara syntax
