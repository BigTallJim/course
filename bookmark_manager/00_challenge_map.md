# Bookmark Manager

This week, you will build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

- Are you having fun?

- Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

- **Can you build a web app that uses a database?**

### Concepts and skills for the week

#### Concepts

- Relationships between data in a database
- Relationships between web applications and databases
- SQL, the database query language
- Task runners
- Environments
- HTML forms
- RESTful routing and Resources
- How ORMs work, at a deep level

#### Skills

- Designing a database schema
- Building a CRUD web application
- Structuring more complex MVC applications
- Refactoring more complex applications
- Learning about unfamiliar tools through experimenting
- Building complex frameworks (e.g. an ORM) from scratch

As well as these things, you'll deepen your understanding of many of the [skills and concepts from week 3](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web).

## The project

You're going to build a bookmark manager.  A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of URLs. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

### User Interface Sketch (Hi-Fi)

This is the basic view of the website. You will build it by working through the sequence of challenges. As you go on, we will be challenging you to extend the functionality of this website.

## Learning, not challenge progress

There is a **lot** of challenge material this week. You're not meant to get through it all.  As always at Makers, focus on deep learning, rather than progression through the challenges.
