## Creating User stories

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

The website will have the following **specification**:

* Show a list of links
* Add new links
* Delete links
* Update links
* Tag links into categories
* Filter links by tag

> A specification is a list of **requirements**.

We'll be using a BDD cycle (i.e. **outside-in testing**: Capybara first). 

To guide us, create some User Stories and sketch a high-level domain model.

> There's no need to create all user stories at once. In fact, doing so can trap us in having to build an app a particular way. Let's just create user stories for the first feature. Once we've built it, we can decide the next one. Same with domain models: don't draw the whole thing. Just jot down enough info to get started. Aim to get coding ASAP.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Generate User Stories from Requirements

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Write a user stories for showing a list of links
- [ ] Draw a rough domain model for the above
- [ ] Put all these user stories and a snap of your domain model in your project README
