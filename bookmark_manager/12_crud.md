## CRUD

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We've built a database-enabled MVC Sinatra application with test and development environments. Bookmarks show on the homepage as a list of clickable anchors to the linked website, nicely titled.

Let's return to our specification:

* Show a list of bookmarks :white_check_mark:
* Add new bookmarks :white_check_mark:
* Delete bookmarks
* Update bookmarks
* Comment on bookmarks
* Tag bookmarks into categories
* Filter bookmarks by tag
* Users manage their bookmarks

In this challenge, you will add functionality to **delete** and **update** bookmarks.

## Learning Objectives

* Create a CRUD system.

## Challenge Setup

There are generally four actions you can take with persistent data:

- **Creating** data
- **Reading** data
- **Updating** data
- **Deleting** data

These are usually abbreviated to the acronym **CRUD**. a CRUD application is one that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data. The majority of web applications are, essentially, CRUD applications.

Remember to maintain RESTful routing conventions.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Complete the 'delete bookmarks' requirement.
- [ ] Complete the 'update bookmarks' requirement.

> As part of these requirements, you'll probably need to write the methods `Bookmark.delete`, `Bookmark.update`, and `Bookmark.find`.
