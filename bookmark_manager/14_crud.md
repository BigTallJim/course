## CRUD

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We've built a database-enabled MVC Sinatra application with test and development environments, validations, and a Rake task for setting it up. Links show on the homepage as a list of clickable anchors to the linked website, nicely titled.

Let's return to our specification:

* Show a list of links :white_check_mark:
* Add new links :white_check_mark:
* Delete links
* Update links
* Comment on Links
* Tag links into categories
* Filter links by tag
* Users manage their links

In this challenge, you will add functionality to **delete** and **update** links.

## Learning Objectives

* Create a CRUD system.

## Challenge Setup

There are generally four actions you can take with persistent data:

- **Creating** data
- **Reading** data
- **Updating** data
- **Deleting** data

These are usually abbreviated to the acronym **CRUD**. a CRUD application is one that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data. The majority of web applications are, essentially, CRUD applications.

In the next challenge, we'll see how so-called RESTful routing conventions relate to CRUD.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Complete the 'delete links' requirement.
- [ ] Complete the 'update links' requirement.

> As part of these requirements, you'll probably need to write the methods `Link.delete`, `Link.update`, and `Link.find`.
