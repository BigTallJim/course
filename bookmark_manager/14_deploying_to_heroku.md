<!-- Now that we have DatabaseCleaner, whenever we run the tests the contents of the database will be deleted, which is a good thing for testing, but it's not what we want in development and production.

In this challenge you will set up your Rack environment variables to ensure a separation between your `test` and `development` environments. -->

## Learning Objectives covered

* Differentiate between `development`, `test`, and `production` environments
* Understand that Heroku is a cloud hosting platform (New LO !!!)
* Be able to depoy a datamapper/postgres app to Heroku (New LO !!!)
* Be able to debug a datamapper/postgres app on Heroku (New LO !!!)

- [ ] Create a Heroku app
- [ ] Configure the Heroku app to include a postgresql database
- [ ] Adjust the bookmark manager app so the database url will work with Heroku
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku and check that all the functionality works
