## First Steps

As you'd do with every new project, create a new repository on Github.  

* Name your project 'bookmark_manager'.
* From your project directory, run `bundle init` to generate a Gemfile.
* In the Gemfile:
  - specify the version of Ruby that you wish to use.
  - make a test group and add `gem 'rspec'` and `gem 'capybara'`
* Run `bundle`.
* Add `require 'capybara/rspec'` to your spec_helper.rb (use `rspec --init` if you're not comfortable creating your own spec_helper).

Commit the changes, push them to Github and switch Driver/Navigator Roles&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:
