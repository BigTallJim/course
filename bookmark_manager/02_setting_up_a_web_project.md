## Setting up a Web Project

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We've written a user story and we have a vague idea of the first interaction. Let's set up:

- a **basic Ruby web project**.
- this first interaction.

> We're going to use Capybara with RSpec and Sinatra.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Set up a Ruby web project.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Set up Sinatra with RSpec and Capybara.
- [ ] Test-drive the first feature: viewing links. Avoid adding a database.

> You'll probably want to create a `Link` class that responds to the class method `.all` with a hard-coded array of `Link` instances.
