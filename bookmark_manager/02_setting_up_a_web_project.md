## Setting up a Web Project

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md#challenges)

We've written a user story and we have a vague idea of the first interaction. Let's set up:

- a **basic Ruby web project**.
- this first interaction.

> We're going to use Capybara with RSpec and Sinatra.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Set up a Ruby web project.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Set up Sinatra with RSpec and Capybara.
- [ ] Test-drive the first feature: viewing links. Avoid adding a database.

## Hints
* You set up a Sinatra project with RSpec and Capybara last week.  Need a reminder?  Click [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/ruby_web_project_setup_list.md)
* You'll probably want to create a `Bookmark` model that responds to the [class method](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/11/class-and-instance-methods-in-ruby/) `.all` with a hard-coded array of `Bookmark` instances.
