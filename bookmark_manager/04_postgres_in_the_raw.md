## Postgres in the raw

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Now that we have a database set up we would like to be able to interact with it, and persist data in it.  There are a number of ways to do this.  A simple default is to do that through the psql command line tool.  In the long run we shouldn't rely on this approach but it's important to practice with it as a backup in order to sanity check how the database is set up.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Use the psql command to interact with Postgres
* Know that 'SQL' means 'Structured Query Language'
* Explain how SQL is used to query databases
* Use SQL query terms like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `*`

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] List the existing database via psql
- [ ] Connect psql to an existing database
- [ ] List the tables in that database
- [ ] Create a basic table with single primary key and name field

# TODO lots of different ways to slice this and the following SQL CRUD exercises
