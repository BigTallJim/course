# Walkthrough â€“ REST and Resources

[Back to the Challenge](../15_rest.md)

The internet is, at its heart, a way of interacting with various kinds of data from databases. These kinds of data can be Posts, Likes, Comments, News articles, Player coordinates in an online game, Food delivery timing information, and so on.

Each of these 'kinds of data' is called a Resource. So, at its most simple, the internet is a Resource-interaction machine.

> We have only one kind of Resource in our application: Links.

Over time, certain **conventions** have built up for how we should do this kind of Resource-interaction. One of them concerns:

- Which resource we ask about
- What we want to do with that resource

This is the idea of REST.
