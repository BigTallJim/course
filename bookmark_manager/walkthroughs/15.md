# Walkthrough – Registration

[Back to Challenge](../18_registration.md)

We are going to duplicate a lot of the Bookmark functionality to create a User object.

This walkthrough is in 5 parts:

1. Create the `users` table.
2. Write the feature test for registration.
3. Build out the User form and route structure.
4. Create a User model for registration, using `Bookmark` as an inspiration, and saving the user ID to the session.
5. Make the password secure.

## 1. Creating the Users table

> Stages 1 – 5 are available from [this commit](https://github.com/sjmog/bookmark_manager/commit/d3fa868bb2699924cd3418ef77aec697cbbc26b8), if you'd prefer.

We are going to need a table for our User model. It will have:

- A `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, `id`
- A `VARCHAR(60)`, `email`
- A `VARCHAR(140)`, `password`

Rather than do this in `psql`, let's update our Rake task that sets up databases:

```diff
# in Rakefile

task :setup do
  p "Creating databases..."

  ['bookmark_manager', 'bookmark_manager_test'].each do |database|
    connection = PG.connect
    connection.exec("CREATE DATABASE #{ database };")
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: database)
    connection.exec("CREATE TABLE bookmarks(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, url VARCHAR(60), title VARCHAR(60));")
+    connection.exec("CREATE TABLE users(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(60), password VARCHAR(140));")
  end
end
```

Let's also update our test setup so we're truncating the user table between each test:

```diff
# in Rakefile

task :test_database_setup do
  p "Cleaning database..."

  connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')

  # Clear the database
  connection.exec("TRUNCATE bookmarks;")
+  connection.exec("TRUNCATE users;")

  # Add the test data
  connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(1, 'http://www.makersacademy.com', 'Makers Academy');")
  connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(2, 'http://www.google.com', 'Google');")
  connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(3, 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook');")
end
```

At this point, it seems sensible to take a moment to write a script that tears down databases, as well as setting them up. Here's one I wrote: it asks for confirmation from the user, to be extra-safe:

```ruby
task :teardown do
  p "Destroying databases...type 'y' to confirm that you want to destroy the Bookmark Manager databases. This will remove all data in those databases!"

  # Get a confirmation from the user!
  confirm = STDIN.gets.chomp
  return unless confirm == 'y'

  ['bookmark_manager', 'bookmark_manager_test'].each do |database|
    connection = PG.connect
    # Drop each database in the list
    connection.exec("DROP DATABASE #{ database }")
  end
end
```

We can now set up new databases using `rake teardown` followed by `rake setup`.

## 2. Write the feature test

Just like Bookmarks, Users are created by filling out a form. Where the Bookmark form has fields for `url` and `title`, the User form has fields for `email` and `password`. The user flow is:

- Visit the RESTful route `/users/new`
- Fill out the form with an email and password, and hit submit
- See 'Welcome, <email>' on the bookmarks page.

Let's translate that to Capybara-speak:

```ruby
# in spec/features/registration_spec.rb

feature 'registration' do
  scenario 'a user can sign up' do
    visit '/users/new'
    fill_in('email', with: 'test@example.com')
    fill_in('password', with: 'password123')
    click_button('Submit')

    expect(page).to have_content "Welcome, test@example.com"
  end
end
```

## 3. Supply the new User form and route structure

Our route structure will involve:

- a `GET /users/new` route to serve the form
- a `POST /users` route to create the new user
- a redirect from `POST /users` to `/`.

Let's set that up in `app.rb`:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/users/new' do
  erb :"users/new"
end

post '/users' do
  # create the user and then...
  redirect '/'
end
```

Here's the new User form:

```html
<!-- in views/users/new -->

<form action="/users" method="post">
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Now, we need to create the user.

## 4. Create the user

Our post action must create a user. In the past, we've started by putting our database query in the controller. Now that we have a pattern with Bookmark, though, let's jump straight to using the `.create` pattern with User:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/users' do
  User.create(email: params['email'], password: params['password'])
  redirect '/'
end
```

Let's implement a test for creating a User like this:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.create' do
  it 'creates a new user' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    expect(user.id).not_to be_nil
  end
end
```

To solve this test, we need to write a `User.all` method, so let's create a test for that:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.all' do
  it 'returns all users, wrapped in a User instance' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    expect(User.all.map(&:id)).to include user.id
  end
end
```

And let's solve both of those in `lib/user.rb`:

```ruby
# in lib/user.rb

require 'database_connection'

class User
  attr_reader :id, :email, :password

  def initialize(id, email, password)
    @id = id
    @email = email
    @password = password
  end

  def self.all
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    result.map { |user| User.new(user['id'], user['email'], user['password']) }
  end

  def self.create(options)
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES('#{options[:email]}', '#{options[:password]}') RETURNING id, email, password;")
    User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])
  end
end
```

> Notice that we've immediately implemented the pattern from 'wrapping database data in program objects'. That is: `User.all` returns an array of `User` instances. `User.create` returns a `User` instance.

## 5. Presenting the User email to the signed-in user

We'd like our `views/bookmarks/index.erb` to welcome the user:

```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/index.erb -->

<% if @user %>
  <h1>Welcome, <%= @user.email %></h1>
<% end %>
```

To get this working, let's work backwards from the view again.

How does `@user` get into the view? It will have to come from the controller. Specifically, from the route that renders this view. That's this one:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks' do
  @user = ??? # where does this come from?
  @bookmarks = Bookmark.all
  erb :"bookmarks/index"  
end
```

Users are created in the `POST /users` route. Then, the user is redirected to the `GET /bookmarks` route. **To persist information across a redirect, we need to user the session.**

That is, we can get the `@user` from something like this:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks' do
  # Fetch the user from the database, using an ID stored in the session
  @user = User.find(session[:user_id])
  @bookmarks = Bookmark.all
  erb :"bookmarks/index"  
end
```

> We could also store the entire user in the session. But there are good reasons we won't: one of them is that the session is very small, and can't store very much data.

We therefore need to _put_ the user in the session in the `POST /users` route. To summarise, here's how that will work:

1. `POST /users`, which calls `User.create`. Return a `User` instance (with an attribute of `id`) from the `.create` method.
2. Store the `id` in the `session`, and redirect from `POST /users` to `GET /`. Redirect from `GET /` to `GET /bookmarks`.
3. `GET /bookmarks`. `User.find` using the `id` in the `session`. Return a `User` instance from the `.find` method. Store that in an instance variable, `@user`.
4. Read the user's email from the `@user` instance variable.

Whew, that's a lot. But that's the standard for web applications! Let's built it out part-by-part.

### 1. Store the `id` of the `User` instance in the `session`

First, let's store the `id` of the returned `User` instance in the `session`:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/users' do
  user = User.create(email: params['email'], password: params['password'])
  session[:user_id] = user.id
  redirect('/')
end
```

### 2. Find the User using the `id` stored in the `session`.

Let's return to the `GET /bookmarks` route. In it, we want to find the user from the session:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks' do
  # Fetch the user from the database, using an ID stored in the session
  @user = User.find(session[:user_id])
  @bookmarks = Bookmark.all
  erb :"bookmarks/index"  
end
```

Let's create a test for finding the user in this way:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.find' do
  it 'finds a user by ID' do
    user = User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')

    expect(User.find(user.id).email).to eq user.email
  end
end
```

And the implementation in `User`:

```ruby
# in lib/user.rb

def self.find(id)
  result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '#{id}'")
  User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])
end
```

Our tests are failing at the moment, because we're not handling the case where `session[:user_id]` is nil. Insert a simple test for this:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.find' do
  it 'returns nil if there is no ID given' do
    expect(User.find(nil)).to eq nil
  end
end
```

And a guard clause in the `User.find` method:

```diff
def self.find(id)
+  return nil unless id
  result = DatabaseConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '#{id}'")
  User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])
end
```

Our tests pass: we have created a User model! Now to secure the password.

## 5. Secure the password

At current, our users' passwords are being stored as plaintext strings. This is no good: even a very amateur hacker could get access to everyone's passwords.

While you can write your own password security system yourself, it's generally recommended to use an off-the-shelf solution. Something like **BCrypt** is an industry-standard approach to securing passwords.

> You can think of BCrypt as a magic black box at the moment. If you're interested, do some research on it!

First, let's add `bcrypt` to our Gemfile:

```ruby
# in Gemfile

gem 'bcrypt'
```

And `bundle install`. Next, let's update our `create` command to pass the password through `BCrypt::Password` before saving the password to the database. Test-first, of course:

```ruby
# in spec/user_spec.rb

describe '.create' do
  it 'hashes the password using BCrypt' do
    expect(BCrypt::Password).to receive(:create).with('password123')

    User.create(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')
  end
end
```

Let's update `User.create` to use `BCrypt::Password`:

```ruby
# in lib/user.rb

require 'bcrypt'

class User
  def self.create(options)
    # encrypt the plantext password, options[:password]
    password = BCrypt::Password.create(options[:password])

    # insert the encrypted password into the database, instead of the plaintext one
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES('#{options[:email]}', '#{password}') RETURNING id, email")

    User.new(result[0]['id'], result[0]['email'], result[0]['password'])
  end

  ### rest of the class ###
end
```

We're now storing passwords encrypted in the database.
