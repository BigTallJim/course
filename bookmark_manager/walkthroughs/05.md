# Walkthrough - Manipulating Table Data

[Back to Challenge](../05_manipulating_table_data.md)

In this walkthough, we show how to query and manipulate table data.

1. Using `SELECT` to view the table
2. Using `INSERT` to add data to a table
3. Using `SELECT` to query data
4. Using `DELETE` to delete data
5. Using `UPDATE` to update data

## 1. Using `SELECT` to view the table

From `psql`, list all the existing links:

```
bookmark_manager=# SELECT * FROM links;
```

This command displays all columns from the table "links" and shows us an empty table:

```
id | url
----+------
(0 rows)
```

## 2. Using `INSERT` to add data to a table

### Manual ID

We can add data using `INSERT` in a very manual way:

```
bookmark_manager=# INSERT INTO links VALUES(1, 'http://makersacademy.com');
```

Notice, however, that we have to manually specify the ID (the `1` in the line above) to add data like this. Remember that IDs are meant to be unique. That means that we get a funky error if we try to do this immediately after the above step:

```
bookmark_manager=# INSERT INTO links VALUES(1, 'http://makersacademy.com');
```

### Automatic ID

Since we told ID to be a `SERIAL` type, PostgreSQL will figure out how to increment it on its own. We simply have to scope the value we're interested in inserting:

```
bookmark_manager=# INSERT INTO links (url) VALUES ('http://www.makersacademy.com');
```

Let's add the other three (I'll remove the prompt so there's more space):

```
INSERT INTO links (url) VALUES ('http://www.askjeeves.com');
INSERT INTO links (url) VALUES ('http://www.twitter.com');
INSERT INTO links (url) VALUES ('http://www.facebook.com');
```

## 3. Using `SELECT` to query data

We've already seen how to list all the records in the table:

```
bookmark_manager=# SELECT * FROM links;
```

> It's a good idea to **sanity-check** each step you take with frequent use of `SELECT`.

However, we can do more exciting things with `SELECT`. For instance, we can limit the number of records to the top two:

```
bookmark_manager=# SELECT * FROM links LIMIT 2;
```

Or even scope our query to specific rows of data:

```
bookmark_manager=# SELECT * FROM links WHERE url = 'http://www.makersacademy.com';
```

## 4. Using `DELETE` to delete data

To delete a row from a database table, we can do the following:

```
DELETE FROM links WHERE url = 'http://www.twitter.com';
```

## 5. Using `UPDATE` to update data

To update a table row, we can do this:

```
UPDATE links SET url = 'http://www.google.com' WHERE url = 'http://www.askjeeves.com';
```

> Don't forget to **sanity-check** everything you've done before moving on!
