# Walkthrough - Creating User Stories

[Back to Challenge](../01_creating_user_stories.md)

The precise details of the user stories are up to you. Here's our go:

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of bookmarks on the homepage
```

Here's what I came up with as a domain model:

```
╔════════════╗         .all         ╔════════════╗
║            ║--------------------->║            ║
║ Controller ║ [array of bookmarks] ║  Bookmark  ║
║            ║<---------------------║            ║
╚════════════╝                      ╚════════════╝
```

- When the user visits the index page, their browser sends a message to a controller we built. (this interaction is not pictured)
- When the controller gets the request, it asks the `Bookmark` class to give it all the bookmarks, i.e. the controller asks for `Bookmark.all`.
- The `Bookmark` class goes and gets the bookmarks from the database somehow, and gives back all the bookmarks in an array to the controller.
- The controller renders the array of bookmarks to a webpage, which it sends as a response to the user (this interaction is not pictured)

So, it feels like the first things we need are a Controller and a Bookmark class.

> That's enough design for now. We should aim to start coding sooner rather than later.
