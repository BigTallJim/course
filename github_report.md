Github Profile Report - Consuming APIs with JavaScript and JavaScript MVC
=========================================================================

This week's project involves using JavaScript to consume data available from third parties over the network (e.g. Github API data accessed via Ajax) and using more advanced JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks such as AngularJS.

***Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials.  Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.***

*Many thanks to [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie) for the original design of the Ajax material and [Antony Denyer](https://github.com/antonydenyer) for the Angular material*

Version 1 - Ajax
----------------

Let's create a simple Github Profile app purely in client side JavaScript that grabs data from the Github API in order to display specified users avatar, number of followers and number of repos.

Version 2 - Usability
----------------

Let's adjust the simple profile application to ensure that it gives a good user experience even under poor network connectivity, and let's the user know when searches for users have failed or the network connection has timed out.  Please ensure that this version can be deployed to Heroku.

Version 3 - MVC
----------------

Recreate the MVP using AngularJS MVC. Again, please ensure that this version can be deployed to Heroku.

Version 4 - Report Card
----------------

Adjust the application to display a Makers Academy progress report for the user in question, including at least #commits on each relevant Github Repo

Version 5 - Bonus Level
----------------

Include further checks such as creating %completion based on expected number of commits, code smells, SOLID principles etc.
