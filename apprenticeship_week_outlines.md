**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. These include wellbeing and code quality. They are not the topic of any one week, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

## Week 1

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Apply test-driven development
* Use Diode to evidence and reflect on work towards goals

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Boris bikes](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes)
* [Friday - Airport](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/960)

### Practicals

These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.

* [Test Driving](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md)
* [Learn by building: rspec](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/adventures/learning_by_building_rspec.md)
* [TDD Cycle Decision Tree](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/812)
* [Debugging approaches](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/debugging/debugging_approaches.md)
* [TDD a single object](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/813)
* [Git collaboration](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/git_collaboration.md)
