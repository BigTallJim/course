**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. These include wellbeing and code quality. They are not the topic of any one week, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

## Week 1

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Apply test-driven development
* Use Diode to evidence and reflect on work towards goals

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Boris bikes](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes)
* [Friday - Airport](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/960)

### Practicals

These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.

* [Test Driving](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md)
* [Learn by building: rspec](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/adventures/learning_by_building_rspec.md)
* [TDD Cycle Decision Tree](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/812)
* [Debugging approaches](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/debugging/debugging_approaches.md)
* [TDD a single object](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/alicelieutier/projects/813)
* [Git collaboration](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/git_collaboration.md)

## Week 2

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Explain why modularity through encapsulation is useful for developers, tying it to ease of change
* Break up programs into multiple objects which work together, with test coverage

Stretch:

* Test classes in isolation using mocking and dependency injection

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Oystercard](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard)
* [Friday - Takeaway](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/132)

### Practicals

These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.

* [Encapsulation](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/EdwardAndress/projects/981)
* [OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism)](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/EdwardAndress/projects/980)
* [Dependency Injection](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/EdwardAndress/projects/979)
* [Testing OO Relationships](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/EdwardAndress/projects/975)
* [Refactoring with OO](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/EdwardAndress/projects/977)
