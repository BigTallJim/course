# Introduction to Rails

Welcome to Rails week!

Rails is a popular Model View Controller (MVC) web application framework. Sinatra, by comparison, is just a web application framework. Unlike Sinatra, Rails provides guidance as to your higher level architecture such as patterns like MVC.  

Rails is, well...like being 'on rails'. There are fewer decisions for you to make, and more decisions that are made for you. It's 'opinionated'. It favours _convention over configuration_ - the trick to enjoying Rails is to know the conventions and stick to them wherever possible. 


## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you use Rails and its conventions to build a web app?**

#### Secondary goal

To help you towards your primary goal, your secondary goal will be to produce a diagram of how all the parts of Rails interact.

* Draw the diagram on Tuesday.
* Each morning, update the diagram with your latest understanding.

Your diagram can include boxes for every directory and file inside a standard Rails app.

## This Week's Project: Yelp

Yelp is a popular web application that allows users to rate and review restaurants, and find other diner's ratings and comments. For the rest of the week you will be building a clone of this site using Rails. 

There are two tracks: 

1. Build the project in teams, without the walkthrough; or 
2. Take the road oft travelled, and complete the project using the walkthrough.

Both tracks will take you to the same place, but Track 1 is entirely self-led. See the following specification for both.

* [Yelp Project Specification](yelp_project_specification.md)
