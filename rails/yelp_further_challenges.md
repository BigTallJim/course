# Yelp

***As you know, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following code snippets.  Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.***


### Yelp - further challenges

In this extended version of our app, we want to tidy up the UX (user experience). It would be nice if our restaurants showed their average rating. It would also be cool if the page didn't refresh when we clicked on a link but updated dynamically.

Let's see what we can do.

- [Average ratings](yelp_further_challenges/1_average-ratings.md)
- [Adding endorsements](yelp_further_challenges/2_adding-endorsements.md)
- [Using AJAX to update endorsements in real-time](yelp_further_challenges/3_using-ajax.md)
- [Refactoring using partials](yelp_further_challenges/4_using-partials.md)
- [Adding images to restaurants](yelp_further_challenges/5_add_images.md)
- [Uploading images to Amazon Web Services S3](yelp_further_challenges/6_storing_images_aws.md)

***Please work through this walkthrough with a pair partner. Please take turns on the keyboard as the driver as described in the [pairing pill](pills/pairing.md) :pill:.   Please swap driver/navigator roles at least as often as you see the :twisted_rightwards_arrows: sign.***

#### Finally

**Exercise:** When you have finished these exercises, get your app looking as close as possible to the actual Yelp site using bootstrap and other CSS wizardry.
