# Bootstrapping a Rails App

Ruby on Rails is an incredibly comprehensive framework which 'gives you a lot for free'. It's also very easy to set up out of the box but the very first stage often brings a lot of anxiety because there's just so much _stuff._

Rails uses scripts called 'Generators' to accomplish a wide range of tasks for you. The very first being to create your new Rails app.

**WARNING:** There will be some additional flags you will need to add to the `new` generator. They will be to allow you to specify a PostgreSQL database and skip the default test environment (`Test::Unit`).

Once you have successfully installed Rails and generated a new project, you will notice a very large amount of files have been generated. **Have a good long look through them, and familiarise yourself with their intended purpose.** Remember, the scientific method and see if you can hypothesise what might belong where - and why Rails has separated things out this way.

Finally for this stage, we want to achieve the `Hello World` of Rails, which looks something like this:

## Learning Objectives covered

* Bootstrap (set up) a new Rails project (specifying configuration options for a new project)
* Understand Rails' preferred configuration for files and folders


## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Use Rails' built-in generator scripts to create a new project called `yelp_clone`

- [ ] Make sure that you tell Rails you want to use PostgreSQL, and that it can skip the test suite, as you intend to specify your own later

- [ ] Familiarise yourself with the files and folders generated by default
- [ ] Start the Rails server and display the default app homepage in all its glory
