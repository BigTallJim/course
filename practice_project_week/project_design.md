4. Design the MVP interaction.
5. When you've implemented the interaction, return to 3.

## Create one sentence project description

Take the original pitch and refine it into something that you would like to build.

**Deliverable: a one-sentence description of your project**

## List features

Whiteboard, brainstorm, discuss, sketch.

**Deliverable: a list of possible features.**

## Choose the MVP interaction

You've probably come up with a lot of great features.  Choose the one that will define your MVP.  The "skateboard" of your "car".  It often feels like you need lots of features for the MVP, but you usually only need one.  For example:

* Space Invaders: a ship that can fire.
* Eliza automated therapist: a box where you can submit a message.
* A compiler: a program that can parse and execute the program `1` and print the result.

**Deliverable: a one-sentence description of the MVP.**

## Design the MVP interaction

Design a user flow, design a screen interface, sketch, draw flowcharts, whatever you like.

**Deliverable: user stories.**
