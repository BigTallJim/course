# Oystercard Challenge

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last
week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last
week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should
really stretch your skills in Code Design, Ruby, RSpec and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Set up the project:

  * [Create a Gemfile](01_create_gemfile.md)
  * [Create RSpec conventional files](02_initialise_rspec.md)
  * [Learn debugging basics](03_debugging.md)

## Create a basic Oyster card:
  * [Add the balance](04_adding_balance.md)
  * [Enable top up functionality](05_top_up.md)

  * [Deduct the money](07_deducting_money.md)

## Add touch in/out functionality:
  * [Add touch in/out support](08_touch_in_out.md)
  * [Checking mininum balance on touch in](09_min_balance_on_touch_in.md)
  * [Charging for the journey](10_charge_on_touch_out.md)

## Record the journeys
  * [Saving the entry station](11_saving_entry_station.md)
  * [Adding journey history](12_journey_history.md)
  * [Creating the station class](13_create_station_class.md)

## Refactor to extract Journey class
