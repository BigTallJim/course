# Guide for developers

## What are my responsibilities?
Education at Makers Academy is designed to be empowering. Being a software engineer means looking at any problem you encounter and believing "With thoughtful effort, I can solve this."

We trust you with three responsibilities:

* Deciding what to aim for (your goals).
* Determining how to get there (your plan).
* Getting insight into your progress (self-assessment).

We believe that you are the best person to lead these things. This way, when someone asks you how it's going, you should know pretty accurately how you're doing as a software engineer, where you want to get to, and how you're going to get there.

You will know when to put in more effort, when to slow down, change focus, employ your strengths or strengthen your weaknesses. You will know when you are ready to apply for jobs. You're in the driving seat.

So what's our job?

* To support you with the above.
* To provide an environment with the tools and motivation necessary to achieve your goals.

Not everyone will come here knowing how to take control of their own journey — and that's fine. It's our job to give you the prompts and starting-points to train the habits of planning and self-assessment.

And then there's the matter of making the environment here as rich in opportunities to learn as possible. If you're not sure whether your code is readable or not, it should be easy to learn how to determine that, execute it, and then engage productively with the task of improving your code. Moreover, the atmosphere and people around you should inspire you to be better.

## What is my day like?
In weeks 1-5:

* *09.30–10.00: Daily review & planning.* You'll plan your day using our online tool. You will decide which goal to focus on today, what action to take to work towards it, and how to assess your progress.
* *10.00–12.30: Self-directed work.* You'll work according to your plan. Coaches will be running workshops, mini projects. 1:1s, or generally available to chat to.
* *12.30–13.30: Lunch.* Go out in droves to one of Shoreditch's fine local eateries, or there's often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak to!
* *13.30–14.00: Meditation.* Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and helps keep your brain sharp.
* *14.00–18.00: Challenges in pairs.* You'll work on a different set of challenges every week and with a different person every day. These form the main thread of the course and ensure everyone comes out with common important skills like debugging, pair programming, and web development.
* *17.00–18.00: Yoga.* Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Weeks 6-12 are the same but with the *10.00-12.30: Self-directed work* and *14.00-18.00: Challenges in pairs.* sessions replaced by group project work.

Most weekends you'll plan how to achieve your goals within the context of a  weekend challenge that we provide.
