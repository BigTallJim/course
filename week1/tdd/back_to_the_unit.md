# Back to the unit

[Back to the Challenge Map](./_challenge_map.md)

The error happened because you asked a Docking Station to `release_bike`, but you haven't told Ruby that a Docking Station can do that.

All Ruby knows is that Docking Stations are allowed to exist, because the class `DockingStation` has been written.

In this challenge, you will write a unit test for the missing method, and make it pass.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Write a unit test for a method

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Add a line of code in your test file that asks the `docking_station` instance to `release_bike`
- [ ] use `p` to output the result.
- [ ] Run your test file
- [ ] Explain the error to your pair partner
- [ ] Add a method `release_bike` to the `DockingStation` class
- [ ] Run your test file
- [ ] Explain to your pair partner the difference between what you see, and the error you saw before.
