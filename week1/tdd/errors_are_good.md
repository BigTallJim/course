# Errors are good

[Back to the Challenge Map](./_challenge_map.md)

You should have just gotten an error something like this:

```sh
Traceback (most recent call last):
features.rb:1:in '<main>': uninitialized constant DockingStation (NameError)
```

Errors are good. They tell us what the problem is and point us towards where we can go to fix it. Much of a developer's time is spent reading, researching, and understanding the result of error messages.

In this challenge, you will dissect a Command Line error message.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors

- [ ] Write down the file path where the error happened
- [ ] Write down the line number of the error
- [ ] Use the Ruby Documentation to find out what the error means
- [ ] Suggest one way of solving the error.
