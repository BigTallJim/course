# Week 1 Challenges

### Welcome to being a developer

To help structure your work, here are 3 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way.

**However**, remember to use a **problem solving process** to unblock yourself. Use [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/escalation_process.md) template to refine your own process - but stick to it.

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

 **Can you use a test-driven approach to write object-oriented code?**

#### Secondary Goal

Revel in the power TDD gives you :)

After you finish each main challenge make sure to reflect with your pair partner on your learnings. It's a good time to run a [mini-retro](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/student_retrospective.md) to see how you're going to approach the next one.
