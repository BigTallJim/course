#Makerthon

Welcome to Makerthon!

This is a chance for you to build a unique project to test out your newfound code skills.

Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that Makerthon exists in the curriculum. It also provides a safe environment for you to be creative and enjoy exploring new directions with your code. 

It is not a test. It is not a challenge to see how many features you can cram into 3 days. Far more important is that you have 1 feature that is fully tested end-to-end, and that you have worked well together as a team using Agile methodologies.

Makerthon is technology agnostic - we don't mind what tech stack you use, although it would probably be easier on you to use a language or framework that you have learned here!
