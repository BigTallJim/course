#Makerthon

Welcome to Makerthon!

This is a chance for you to build a unique project to test out your newfound code skills.

Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that Makerthon exists in the curriculum. It also provides a safe environment for you to be creative and enjoy exploring new directions with your code. 

It is not a test. It is not a challenge to see how many features you can cram into 3 days. Far more important is that you have 1 feature that is fully tested end-to-end, and that you have worked well together as a team using Agile methodologies.

Makerthon is technology agnostic - we don't mind what tech stack you use, although it would probably be easier on you to use a language or framework that you have learned here!

##Learning Objectives

* Agile
* Kanban
* Time Management
* Teamwork
* Git branches
* Testing
* User stories
* Minimum Viable Product
* Scrums
* Pairing
* Delegating workload

> Comments from Ben
Agile - the key target learnings here are EDUF and the difference between increments and iterations.
Kanban - Kanban IS NOT putting sticky notes on a board - that's just tracking a project using sticky notes on a board.  If we call it Kanban, then we should explain WIP limits and pull-not-push.  Otherwise it explicitly is not Kanban.
Git branches - every project team I've seen so far has messed up git branches.  Let's ensure everyone has the right pattern from the start.  One of the objectives of Makerthon is to practice using git branches properly.
Testing - specifically using outside-in testing.  Not a line of code should be written until there is a feature test in place to enable it.
User stories - how a user story is structured and how it can be used to create a feature test.
Pairing/Scrums/Teamwork etc.  - These are all now at the Apply, Analyze, Evaluate etc. level - so the objectives are to practice these correctly.
