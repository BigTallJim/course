* Makers week becomes less structured over time

* Office Hours (8am-9pm)
* Access to coaches 
  - supporting you becoming active learners 
  - coach exhaustion
  - wean yourself off the coaches and alumni helpers
* Weekly schedule - subject to change

Ultimately we want all of you to be able to manage the whole web development stack, completely independently of us.

The Agile process is the heart of Makers Academy:
