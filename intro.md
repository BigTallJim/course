Introduction
===========

* New Office - main challenge is currently water

Overview of the Makers Week
-------------------------

* Challenges - review on Mondays, released on Friday
* Challenges are a simulation of employer tech tests

Each day there are morning and afternoon sessions.

You can see the approximate weekly structure in the Calendar wiki:

https://github.com/makersacademy/course/wiki/Calendar

This structure is maintained consistenly for the first five weeks, but then gradually the structure is removed:

**Junior Portion**

1    |  2          | 3               | 4                | 5          | 6              |
-----|-------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
Boris Bikes   | Battleships | Battleships Web | Bookmark Manager | JavaScript | Lab Week |


**Senior Portion**

7    |  8    | 9                 | 10               | 11     | 12     |
-----|-------|-------------------|------------------|--------|--------|
Node | Makerthon (Teams) | Rails | Project 1 | Project 2 |   Employment Week |




* Office Hours (8am-9pm)
* Access to coaches 
  - supporting you becoming active learners 
  - coach exhaustion
  - wean yourself off the coaches and alumni helpers
* Weekly schedule - subject to change

Ultimately we want all of you to be able to manage the whole web development stack, completely independently of us.

The Agile Process
---------------

The Agile process is the heart of Makers Academy.  In contrast to the big design up front approach of give us Â£8M to build a system and we'll see you in two years, and it turns out that it doesn't work.

![Agile Process](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/agile.png)

This agile process is fundamental - it's about making sure that the process you are using to get towards your goal is being tuned to ensure that you are moving effectively towards your goal.

Three Tier Web Architecture
----------------

Here's a simple overview of the three tier web architecture that is the critical technical concept that you must have in your head to be a successful web developer.  It's all about a process of communication between a user's web browser and a server.  A server is just another computer, but it's often a computer with a dedicated internet connection and lots of resources.  It will also usually consist of a web server (to serve web pages), and application engine (to allow dynamic generation of those pages) and a database (to reliably store data related to those pages):

![Three Tier Simple](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/3-tier-simple.png)

If we drill down a little we can see the HTTP protocol that is the lingua franca of the web and is the communication mechanism that allows the web to exist across multiple computers.  We can also see that the application engine is where web developers have to handle a lot of the complexity.  That is not to say that databases and web servers can't become very complex.  In fact they are very complex, but often they are used by web developers out of the box, and it's the application engine that takes up the most time.  It's technologies relating to the application engine that will take up a good proportion of the time at Makers.

Drilling down even further we can see the names of the many technologies, languages, frameworks and protocols that are used at the different levels in the three tier application stack, as well as examples of what some of these look like.  This diagram will largely seem like gobbledigook at the beginning of the course.  By the end of the course it will seem much clearer.  There will still be grey areas, but you will start to feel comfortable with knowledge of the different moving parts that allow you to create and problem shoot large web applications.

![Three Tier Detail](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/3-tier.png)

However note that there is far more complexity here than we can cover in 12 weeks.  Ultimately you will need to become a self-directed learner and drill down further in the areas that your agile process indicates you have greater need for knowledge.

This is the Rosetta Stone of web development.  We want you to be great programmers and great project managers, and great team members, but critically we are focused on helping you become web developers, so understanding this architecture is key.
