# Playing Battleships in the browser

This time we are going to improve on our battleships game. 
In [the last project](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/battle_ships.md) 
we implemented the battleships game for the terminal. 

Whilst interacting with the computer on the terminal is an essential skill 
for us developer types, it is far from the preferred way to interact with 
your computer for people in general. When was the last time you checked your calendar on the terminal? **Exactly!**

Nowadays applications are much richer in colours and interactions, they feel 
smoother and friendlier that the terminal does.

The web offers a wonderful plethora of technologies and possibilities to 
build applications. It's time for us to look into web technologies and play 
with them.

**How about being able to  play battleships on the browser?**

## Version 0: Setting up

The first thing we have to do is to setup our project so that it's ready for us to start working on it.

Last week you created a playable battleships game for the terminal. You separated the logic of the game from the view ( _how the game is presented to the players_ ), making it extensible in that direction ( _if you did not, there is a version of battleships you can clone and use LINK_ ).

What we are going to do is to first put our code into the right places into the ``lib`` and ``spec`` directories and make sure that everything is still working... **Hang on! We need a Gemfile first!**

````ruby
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org

group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec'
end
````

Once you've bundled the `Gemfile` run `rspec` and makes sure everything is working.
