# Playing Battleships in the browser

This time we are going to improve on our battleships game.
In [the last project](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/battle_ships.md) we implemented the battleships game for the terminal.

Whilst interacting with the computer on the terminal is an essential skill for us developer types, it is far from the preferred way to interact with your computer for people in general. When was the last time you checked your calendar on the terminal? **Exactly!**

Nowadays applications are much richer in colours and interactions, they feel smoother and friendlier that the terminal does.

The web offers a wonderful plethora of technologies and possibilities to build applications. It's time for us to look into web technologies and play with them.

**How about being able to  play battleships on the browser?**

## Version 0: Setting up

The first thing we have to do is to setup our project so that it's ready for us to start working on it.

Last week you created a playable battleships game for the terminal. You separated the logic of the game from the view ( _how the game is presented to the players_ ), making it extensible in that direction ( _if you did not, there is a version of battleships you can clone and use LINK_ ).

First we need to make sure that the code we wrote for battleships is in the right places. As before we will need a ``lib`` and a ``spec`` directory. [Sinatra](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/sinatra_1.md) can work with only these directories, but in a _"real"_ project you will see a few more. By the end of this project our directory structure will look a little more complex than what we have seen so far:

```
.
|---README.md
|---config.ru
|---Gemfile
|---Gemfile.lock
|---features
    |---step_definitions
    |---support
|---lib
|---public
|---spec
|---views
    |---styles
    |---layouts
```

 **Hang on! We need a Gemfile!**

Our Gemfile helps us to keep track of the gems ( _and the versions of the gems_ ) we want to use in our project, so that when we clone the project from another computer we'll be able to  have all we need. Let's look at the Gemfile we are going to need during our project:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'sinatra'

group :development, :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'cucumber'
  gem 'cucumber-sinatra'
  gem 'launchy'
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'shotgun'
end
```

_You might have noticed that we have ordered the gems alphabetically. This is for practical reasons. In bigger projects that use a lot of different gems we want to make sure that we find them in our Gemfile fairly quickly._

Once you've bundled the `Gemfile` run `rspec` and make sure everything is working ( _did you remember to add your code into the lib and spec directories?_ ).

Now that your specs are passing and the code is all in place we are ready to start working on our battleships online game!

## Version 1: Building an application from the outside in

Everything is setup and ready, but how do we start? If you have been following best practices you know that you have to write a failing test before you write any code. That was a relatively easy task when we were talking about simpler applications. This time though we are building a full fledged web application; our friends and family can play with our app!

**Let's get started then, shall we?**

One of the gems you should have in your system now is ``cucumber-sinatra``. This gem will help you setting up cucumber.

Cucumber is a testing tool written by Aslak Helles√∏y that let's you describe your application in plain english. The description of your system, the features, will interact with your application and prove that it works as described ([Cucumber Pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/cucumber.md)).

In your projects directory run:

```shell-session
cucumber-sinatra init --app  BattleShips lib/battleships.rb
Generating with init generator:
     [ADDED]  features/support/env.rb
     [ADDED]  features/support/paths.rb
     [ADDED]  features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb
     [ADDED]  lib/battleships.rb
     [ADDED]  config.ru
```

This has added some directories and files in our application directory. If we run cucumber now we will see the following output:

```shell-session
cucumber
0 scenarios
0 steps
0m0.000s
```

Let's write the first scenario of our first feature (`features/starting_a_game.feature`):

```cucumber
Feature: Starting the game
  In order to play battleships
  As a nostalgic player
  I want to start a new game

  Scenario: Registering
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "New Game"
    Then I should see "What's your name?"
```

Running cucumber now looks very different than it did before:

```shell-session
cucumber
Feature: Starting the game
  In order to play battleships
  As a nostalgic player
  I want to start a new game

  Scenario: Registering                   # features/starting_a_game.feature:6
    Given I am on the homepage            # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:19
    When I follow "New Game"               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:27
      Unable to find button "New Game" (Capybara::ElementNotFound)
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:29:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:14:in `with_scope'
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:28:in `/^(?:|I )follow "([^\"]*)"(?: within "([^\"]*)")?$/'
      features/starting_a_game.feature:8:in `When I follow "New Game"'
    Then I should see "What's your name?" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:107

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/starting_a_game.feature:6 # Scenario: Registering

1 scenario (1 failed)
3 steps (1 failed, 1 skipped, 1 passed)
0m0.053s
```

**What did just happen?** Cucumber is telling us that it cannot find a button named _New Game_ in the homepage. But, how is it possible that cucumber was able to go to the homepage? Which homepage? At this point in time we haven't even created anything apart from our feature file. What's going on?

Start your sinatra application

```shell-session
rackup
[2014-05-19 17:57:39] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2014-05-19 17:57:39] INFO  ruby 2.1.2 (2014-05-08) [x86_64-darwin13.0]
[2014-05-19 17:57:39] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=14728 port=9292
```

and point your browser to your application ( _[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)_ ).

Why is sinatra greeting us with a "Hello BattleShips!" message?

If you open your `lib/battleships.rb` file you will see why:

````ruby
require 'sinatra/base'

class BattleShips < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    'Hello BattleShips!'
  end

  # start the server if ruby file executed directly
  run! if app_file == $0
end
````

When we initialised cucumber with sinatra-cucumber we told it to generate our application as well. That's why we now have our BattleShips controller returning that greeting.

To make the first step work we need to do a few things:

- create a views directory
- tell our `BattleShips` controller where the views are
- create an `index.erb` file with the html ( _containing a link with the text 'New Game'_ )

Running cucumber again after we have finished these tasks we will see the following:

```shell-session
Feature: Starting the game
  In order to play battleships
  As a nostalgic player
  I want to start a new game

  Scenario: Registering                   # features/starting_a_game.feature:6
    Given I am on the homepage            # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:19
    When I follow "New Game"               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:27
    Then I should see "What's your name?" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:107
      expected to find text "What's your name?" in "New Game" (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:110:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:14:in `with_scope'
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:108:in `/^(?:|I )should see "([^\"]*)"(?: within "([^\"]*)")?$/'
      features/starting_a_game.feature:9:in `Then I should see "What's your name?"'

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/starting_a_game.feature:6 # Scenario: Registering

1 scenario (1 failed)
3 steps (1 failed, 2 passed)
```

**We are almost there!** Now we only need to change the button so that it actually takes us to a new page that will ask us for our name. Once we have done this we will see the following output from cucumber:

```shell-session
Feature: Starting the game
  In order to play battleships
  As a nostalgic player
  I want to start a new game

  Scenario: Registering                   # features/starting_a_game.feature:6
    Given I am on the homepage            # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:19
    When I press "New Game"               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:27
    Then I should see "What's your name?" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:107

1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
0m0.035s
```

OK, our cukes (that's a common name to refer to cucumber features) are passing now, but there is something wrong with the scenario we specified; it said Registering, but we hardly have registered for a new game... Can you modify the scenario to add the necessary steps to make it pass?

**Tasks**

- Add steps to the scenario
- Add a scenario for when the player does not input his name

## Version 2: Making the game playable

We have now the first walking skeleton of our application and we are ready to add more features to describe our application.

For this to happen we need to introduce the concept of a session to our application and make it _remember_ who is playing against whom. We also need to make sure that our application only allows 2 players per game.

**Task: Write the following features (and add the functionality to the application):**

- Registering a second player
- Placing the ships
- Shooting at each others boards in turns
- Winning and loosing

## Version 3: Multigame battleships

Up until now our application has been running only for two players at a time. Can you make it work with any amount of players and games ( obviously with two players per game )?

## Final touches

It would be nice if our battleships game looked like something that people wanted to play with, maybe we should be looking at it :wink:

Once we have added some CSS goodness let's deploy our application to heroku and share it with the world!

**Congratulations! You have released your first application!**
