# How to Request a Code Review


**tl;dr**
Use this [form][1] to request a review of your weekend challenge or codebase. A coach will then review and give feedback as notes on the PR or via slack.

---
Most of the following are self-explanatory, but in order to submit the form the following information is required:

### First & Last Name
So the coach knows where to send feedback

### URL
The link to the Github Pull Request or repository

### Mini Review
This is by far the most important piece here: please outline what you want feedback on by analysing your code and include the following reflections:
- what do you think you did well
- what do you think was hard or confusing
- what do you want to improve on
- what would you work on if you had more time

It can be a paragraph/bullet points sent via slack, or notes on your own PR. The better your review is, the more helpful the coach's code review can be as the coach will better understand the feedback that will benefit you.

#### NB: A coach will not review code that hasn't a mini-review by the requester.


---

As always if you have questions about this process or feedback to share about it, please don't hesitate to slack a coach.
