#Chat Servers in Node

**[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

Welcome to Node! This week, you will be learning how to build realtime applications using JavaScript across the whole stack. At the end of the week you will have a basic chat server and client harnessing the awesome power of Websockets.

**Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials. Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.**

##Version 1 - Welcome to Node

Before we get into Websockets, we need to be able to build a basic server. But before we build a web server, we need to understand what Node is and how to get started.
Check out the [Introduction to Node](https://github.com/makersacademy/Walkthroughs/blob/master/intro_to_node.md) walkthrough to get started, then, when you have finished, check out [Node good practices](https://github.com/makersacademy/Walkthroughs/blob/master/node_good_practices.md). 

##Version 2 - A basic server 

Next, let's get a server running, with tests: [A basic Node server](https://github.com/makersacademy/Walkthroughs/blob/master/basic_node_server.md).

Now that we have a server, we want to be able to display dynamic content, as well as be able to configure our server's routes:

##Version 3 - Let's get chatting
