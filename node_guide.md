Welcome to Node!

**Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials. Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.**

* [Introduction to Node](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/node/intro_to_node.md)  
* [A basic Node server](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/node/basic_node_server.md)  
* [Express, `ejs` and middleware](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/node/express_ejs.md)  

**WARNING: we have recently found that testing with CasperJS to be unreliable when it comes to more complex behaviour and dynamic pages. In this case we recommend [Selenium and Webdriver](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_acceptance_tests.md)**
