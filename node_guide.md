#Chat Servers in Node

**[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

Welcome to Node! This week, you will be learning how to build realtime applications using JavaScript across the whole stack. At the end of the week you will have a basic chat server and client harnessing the awesome power of Websockets.

**Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials. Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.**

##Version 1 - A basic server

Before we get into Websockets, we need to be able to build a basic server. But before we build a web server, we need to understand what Node is. 
Check out the [Introduction to Node](https://github.com/makersacademy/Walkthroughs/blob/master/intro_to_node.md) walkthrough to get started.

##Version 2 - Static pages and EJS templates

##Version 3 - Let's get chatting
