# Styling

> Make it perty.

Web page styling is simultaneously considered to be a dark art, available to the chosen few who truly know CSS, and somehow less valuable than being able to rummage around in the backend of an application.

Neither of these things is true. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a bit weird, but it's perfectly understandable once you grasp the rudiments. After that, it's a matter of remembering a bunch of properties and how to use them. Besides, very few people write CSS any more: it's all about Sassy CSS (SCSS) nowadays.

In this module, we're going to introduce:

- CSS for typography
- The basics of the box model
- SCSS and pre-processing :construction:
- Using CSS sensibly :construction:
- Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS) :construction:
- Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) :construction:
