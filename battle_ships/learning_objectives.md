##Learning Objectives: BattleShips

*Learning Objectives are organised by topic. As you go down the bullet-point list below each topic header, skills become more advanced/involved.*

In general this week should consolidate all of the learning objectives from week 1 and the student should be able to apply all of them to an OO system of intermediate complexity.

## Domain Model and MVP/MVp

* Can create a domain model of intermediate complexity
* Can use CRC cards to help develop a model
* Can determine which part of a domain model to implement to support a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Can use a sequence of discrete stages of Minimum Viable Prototypes (MVps) to get to an MVP via BDD/TDD

## Inheritance vs Composition, Encapsulation and Polymorphism; Open/Closed Principle

* Can describe the different between Inheritance and Composition in an OO system
* Can employ both inheritance and composition in OO design
* Can describe why encapsulation is important
* Can assess appropriate use of encapsulation within an OO system
* Can develop an appropriately encapsulated OO system
* Can describe what polymorphism is
* Can use polymorphic approaches to support the open/closed principle

## Class Methods, Single Responsibility Principle

* Feel comfortable with class methods and know when there is a good time to use them.
* Explain how to use a class method to get rid of "magic numbers" from your code and make instantiation of an object more readable.
* Able to explain Single Responsibility Principle and why it's important.  

## Blocks, Procs & Lambdas

* Be aware there is a difference between blocks, procs and lambdas
* Use them in iterators (e.g. map, inject)
* Understand how to implement a method using a block
* Passing procs / lambdas as arguments
* Usage in testing (e.g expect { x }.to raise_error)

## Dependency Injection/Inversion

* Understanding Dependency Injection
* Understanding Dependency Inversion

## Gems/APIs

* Understanding what a Gem is
* Be able to use Gemfile and bundle to control gems for a project
* Can explain how the Gemfile.lock file operates to ensure consistent use of libraries
* Understanding what an online API is

# UX/UI

* Explain what UX and UI are and some of the challenges involved in their design


Weekly Challenge
===========

## Inject

**Learning Objectives**

* Comprehensive understanding of the yield method
* Comprehensive understanding of Ruby styles such as inject
* Test driven development (TDD)


## TakeAway

**Learning Objectives**

* Use of gems and APIs
* Ability to effectively mock 3rd party APIs in order to avoid test suites being bad net citizens
* Further OOD and OOP practice
